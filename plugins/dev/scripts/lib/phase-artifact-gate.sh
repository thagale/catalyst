#   match_thoughts_artifact <dir> <ticket>
#       Slug-tolerant, boundary-safe, case-insensitive matcher.
#       Prints matching filenames; returns 0 if at least one match, 1 otherwise.

# ─── Slug-tolerant, boundary-safe, case-insensitive matcher ────────────────────

# match_thoughts_artifact <dir> <ticket>
#
# Finds thoughts artifacts in <dir> that belong to <ticket>.
# Accepts both the tail form (…-ctl-1081.md) and the slug form (…-ctl-1081-<slug>.md).
# The word-boundary guard (-${lc}. and -${lc}-) rejects cross-ticket lookalikes
# (e.g. ctl-10812 does NOT satisfy a ctl-1081 gate). Case-insensitive matching
# absorbs the uppercase-ticket convention (CTL-1081 writer, ctl-1081 glob) in
# one step.
#
# Deliberately shell-agnostic (no `shopt`, no bash array-glob): this file's
# shebang says bash, but in practice callers have sourced it under an
# interactive zsh session rather than invoking via `bash -c` as intended.
# `shopt` is not a zsh builtin, so `shopt -s nullglob nocaseglob` silently
# failed under zsh (non-fatal, execution continued) and the SUBSEQUENT glob ran
# under zsh's own default (non-nullglob, error-on-no-match) semantics instead
# of bash's — producing an empty match with no error surfaced, which this
# function's callers read as "prior artifact missing" even when it existed.
# Confirmed root cause behind at least one false plan-phase stall (see
# PROJ-39's friction log) — real research/plan docs existed on disk, but the
# gate reported them missing. `find -iname` performs the identical
# slug-tolerant, boundary-safe, case-insensitive match without depending on
# either shell's array/glob-option extensions, so sourcing this file under
# bash OR zsh now behaves identically. Bash-3.2 safe: uses tr for lowercasing,
# no mapfile.
#
# Depth-limited via `-maxdepth 1`, deliberately NOT the `-prune`+`-path`
# idiom that's sometimes used to avoid `-maxdepth`: an earlier revision of
# this function used `find "$dir" -type d ! -path "$dir" -prune -o ...` to
# sidestep -maxdepth, but `-path` pattern-matches its argument (fnmatch-style
# glob, same as `-name`/`-iname`) rather than comparing it literally — so a
# <dir> containing glob metacharacters (e.g. a worktree path like
# `repo[1]/thoughts/shared/research`) never matches `-path "$dir"` against
# itself, gets pruned as if it were an unrelated subdirectory, and the whole
# directory silently returns no matches even though the file is right there
# (reproduced with `repo[1]/2026-01-01-proj-1.md`; confirmed via Codex review).
# `-maxdepth` carries no such risk (it's a purely numeric depth bound, no
# path/pattern matching involved) and is supported identically by both GNU
# find (Linux CI) and BSD find (macOS, this repo's primary fleet host — see
# `find(1)`'s "-maxdepth n ... extensions to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001"), so it is
# the safer choice here despite not being in the POSIX base spec.
# `! -name '.*'` excludes dotfiles (macOS AppleDouble `._*` siblings, editor
# swap files) to match the previous glob's default (non-dotglob) behavior,
# which silently skipped leading-dot basenames. Output is piped through `sort`
# so callers doing `tail -1` for "most recent" get a deterministic,
# lexicographically-last result — raw find traversal order is filesystem-
# dependent and not guaranteed to match creation or name order.
