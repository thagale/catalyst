# lib/linear-app-actor.sh — CTL-1577: shared Linear app-actor token mint for daemon start paths.
#
# Extracted from catalyst-execution-core's CTL-785 inline block so BOTH long-lived
# daemons (execution-core AND the broker) authenticate to Linear as the Catalyst
# Orchestrator app-actor — its own per-app 5000/hr OAuth bucket — instead of
# inheriting the operator's personal lin_api_ key from the login shell. All
# personal keys share ONE per-user 2500/hr bucket, so a daemon that leaks through
# on the env token drains the operator's interactive quota fleet-wide (the
# broker's cache-reconcile board walk was the CTL-1577 RCA).
#
# linear_app_actor_auth <daemon-name> [target-env-var] [secret-id] [display-name]
#   Mints a fresh client_credentials token from <secret-id>'s config path in the
#   global config (default: linear-orchestrator-actor, i.e.
#   catalyst.linear.bot.orchestrator.{clientId,clientSecret} — UNCHANGED from
#   every call site that omits the new params).
#   --noproxy keeps the mint off the audit MITM (curl can't trust its CA).
#   Fail-open (parity with CTL-785): a failed mint logs a loud warning and leaves
#   the existing env token intact so the daemon still starts; a missing
#   app config is a silent no-op. <daemon-name> prefixes the log lines so each
#   daemon's log stays attributable.
#
#   <secret-id> (default "linear-orchestrator-actor") and
#   <display-name> (default "Catalyst Orchestrator app-actor") let a caller
#   mint from a DIFFERENT app-actor identity — e.g.
#   linear_app_actor_auth "phase-agent-dispatch" CATALYST_PHASE_AGENT_LINEARIS_TOKEN
#   linear-linearis-actor "Catalyst linearis app-actor" mints the dedicated
#   linearis identity instead. Every other default-arg caller (execution-core,
#   broker, catalyst-monitor.sh) is byte-for-byte unaffected — both new params
#   default to the values every existing call already hardcoded.
#
#   Default (no target-env-var): exports LINEAR_API_TOKEN + LINEAR_API_KEY —
#   the broker/execution-core behavior, UNCHANGED.
#
#   With <target-env-var>: exports ONLY that variable, leaving
#   LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY untouched — and ACTIVELY CLEARS any
#   inherited LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY first (CTL-1612 round 4, see
#   below). CTL-1612: catalyst-monitor uses this scoped form (target var
#   CATALYST_MONITOR_APP_ACTOR_TOKEN) because the monitor is two-identity —
#   its inline-reply path (linear-comment.mjs resolveLinearToken) must keep
#   resolving the OPERATOR's personal token, and a blanket LINEAR_API_TOKEN
#   export here outranks that resolution (env beats Layer-2), making every
#   reply 502 bot_identity. Only the monitor's own self-reads (the
#   peer-heartbeat anchor read) opt into the scoped var.
#
#   CTL-1612 round 7 (Codex P2 follow-up): whenever <target-env-var> is set,
#   a companion "<target-env-var>_SOURCE" var is ALSO exported —
#   "minted" for a genuinely fresh mint, "inherited" for a round-6 fallback
#   reuse. A caller (server.ts) that wants to know "is this token fresh
#   enough to skip an immediate re-mint" must check this marker, not just
#   whether the target var is merely present — an inherited fallback can be
#   near its own expiry.
#
#   CTL-1612 round 4 (Codex P1 follow-up): scoped mode also CLEARS a
#   non-personal LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY it finds ALREADY set on
#   entry — not just "never adds" them. catalyst-broker calls this function
#   UNSCOPED at its own startup (exports the app-actor token under those two
#   names into the broker's own process env), and broker/stack-reload.mjs's
#   restart spawn carries no `env` override, so `catalyst-monitor restart` —
#   issued automatically after a plugin-source stack reload — inherits the
#   broker's env verbatim. Without the clear, that inherited bot-valued alias
#   survives into the monitor's env untouched (the scoped branch previously
#   only promised not to ADD LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY, never that it
#   would REMOVE an inherited one), resolveLinearToken picks it before the
#   personal Layer-2 token (env beats Layer-2), and every inline reply 502s
#   bot_identity again — the SAME P1 as round 1's original finding,
#   resurfacing through a different door (inheritance, not this script's own
#   export).
#
#   CTL-1612 round 5 (Codex P2 follow-up): the clear is PRECISE, not
#   unconditional — see linear_app_actor_clear_inherited below. A genuinely
#   personal `lin_api_*` key survives; anything else (bot/oauth-shaped, or
#   unrecognized) is cleared. A round-4 unconditional clear also deleted a
#   LEGITIMATE personal credential for an operator who runs the monitor from
#   a shell with their own `lin_api_*` exported and no Layer-2 personal token
#   configured — the estimate/title fallbacks
#   (linear-estimate-fallback.mjs/linear-title-description-fallback.mjs)
#   resolve ONLY LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY, with no Layer-2 tier at
#   all, so that launch configuration lost board enrichment entirely and
#   inline replies returned `no_token`.
#
# Idempotent-source guard — safe to source multiple times.

# linear_app_actor_clear_inherited <daemon-name>
#   CTL-1612 rounds 4/5: clears any INHERITED LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY
#   that is NOT a personal `lin_api_*` key — i.e. bot/oauth-shaped or
#   unrecognized-shaped values only. A genuinely personal key survives
#   untouched (see the round-5 header comment above for why). Matching is
#   case-insensitive (lowercased before the prefix check) for parity with the
#   codebase's other credential-shape check (cluster-heartbeat.mjs/
#   cluster-claim.mjs authHeader: `/^lin_oauth/i`) — Linear's own API
#   distinguishes the two credential kinds by this exact prefix (Bearer vs.
#   raw Authorization header), a REAL, functionally load-bearing split, not
#   just a naming convention. Logs ONLY when something was actually cleared.
#
#   CTL-1612 round 6 (Codex P2 follow-up): each value is TRIMMED of
#   surrounding whitespace before the prefix check — matching
#   orch-monitor/lib/linear-comment.mjs's resolveLinearToken, the definitive
#   consumer, which does `.trim()` on its resolved env value before ever
#   comparing/using it. Without the trim, a padded personal credential
#   (`LINEAR_API_TOKEN="  lin_api_…"`) would classify as non-personal here and
#   get cleared, even though the token that reaches resolveLinearToken (which
#   sees the SAME padded value and trims it there) would have worked fine.
#
#   Factored out of linear_app_actor_auth's scoped branch so a caller that
#   needs to skip the MINT ENTIRELY (no orchestrator work to do at all — e.g.
#   catalyst-monitor.sh's loki-only or no-liveness-anchor skip paths,
#   CTL-1612 round 5) can still close the inherited-bot-alias gap without
#   attempting a network call. linear_app_actor_auth's own scoped branch
#   calls this too, so every scoped entry point gets the same guarantee
#   regardless of whether it goes on to mint.
#
#   CTL-1612 round 6 (Codex P2 follow-up, resilience refinement): before
#   clearing, the FIRST bot/oauth-shaped value found (LINEAR_API_TOKEN
#   preferred over LINEAR_API_KEY, matching linear-comment.mjs
#   resolveLinearToken's own precedence) is captured into the breadcrumb
#   LAA_LAST_CLEARED_TOKEN — reset at the top of every call, so a caller
#   always reads either THIS call's capture or empty, never a stale one from
#   a previous invocation. This is what lets linear_app_actor_auth's scoped
#   branch reuse a USABLE inherited app-actor token as a fallback if its own
#   mint then fails, instead of discarding a working credential and leaving
#   the scoped target var empty (self-reads would otherwise go dark until
#   the NEXT successful mint, even though the inherited token could have
#   served them in the meantime). The aliases are unset in EVERY case
#   regardless of what gets captured — the round-4/5 P1 contract (never let
#   a non-personal alias survive into resolveLinearToken's env-first
#   resolution) holds unconditionally.

# CTL-1612 round 9 (Codex P2 follow-up): tiered JSON parsing for the mint
# chain — jq → bun -e → node -e — mirroring the create-worktree.sh #2966
# packageManager-sniff precedent (same reasoning: prefer a REAL JSON parser
# whenever one happens to be on PATH; jq is neither a required nor optional
# repo dependency and bootstrap does not enforce it). Without this, a
# supported host without jq — anchor configured, orchestrator creds
# configured — could never populate CATALYST_MONITOR_APP_ACTOR_TOKEN even
# though bun (which every monitor host already has, since it's what RUNS the
# monitor) or node could parse the exact same JSON.
#
# SECURITY (unchanged from the jq-only version): the JSON document parsed
# here — the orchestrator client credentials, and the OAuth token response —
# is credential material. It travels via STDIN in every tier, never as an
# argv string or embedded in the one-shot script text (the field NAME, e.g.
# "clientId", is the only argv arg, and that is never secret). `bun -e`/
# `node -e` read stdin the identical way a script file would.
#
# SCOPE NOTE: this closes the gap ONLY for linear-app-actor.sh's OWN
# field-parsing (the clientId/clientSecret/access_token extraction and the
# two @uri encodes below). It does NOT touch catalyst_resolve_secret's own,
# SEPARATE jq dependency (lib/catalyst-secret-contract.sh's
# _csc_read_json_string — the Layer-2 config-json READ that populates
# CATALYST_SECRET_LAST_VALUE / `$_creds` below) — that function has its OWN
# jq gate (`command -v jq || { printf '@ABSENT'; return 0; }`) and is core,
# heavily-hardened, hostile-input-tested shared infrastructure used by every
# config-json registry row (worker-actor, cloud-token, groq-api-key, …), not
# something scoped to "the monitor's mint chain". A truly jq-less host today
# still can't RESOLVE the orchestrator creds in the first place (a separate,
# pre-existing, deliberately-scoped limitation) — this fix makes what
# linear-app-actor.sh itself does with a JSON string, once it HAS one,
# jq-independent. See the round-9 report for why extending
# _csc_read_json_string itself was judged out of proportion for this finding.
