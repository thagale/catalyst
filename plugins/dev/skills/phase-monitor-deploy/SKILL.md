name: phase-monitor-deploy
description: Phase agent that watches the post-merge deployment for a ticket. Reads the merge SHA from phase-monitor-merge.json (the signal file phase-monitor-merge writes after `gh pr merge` confirms via REST), subscribes via `catalyst-events wait-for` to deploy events on that SHA, then delegates a live verification check to the /canary skill (gstack). Emits phase.monitor-deploy.complete.<TICKET> on canary success, phase.monitor-deploy.failed.<TICKET> on deploy or canary failure, and phase.monitor-deploy.skipped.<TICKET> when no deploy event arrives before the timeout. Dispatched by the phase-agent orchestrator (CTL-452) via slash command — `user-invocable: true` so the dispatcher's `claude --bg "/catalyst-dev:phase-monitor-deploy ..."` resolves.

# phase-monitor-deploy

Greenfield phase agent shipped in CTL-451 (Initiative 1 Phase 5). Runs after `phase-pr` has merged
the PR. Subscribes to GitHub `deployment_status` events on the merge commit SHA, then delegates
canary verification to `/canary` (gstack) once the deploy reaches a terminal state.

Optimized for Haiku — the body is purely procedural shell. The model context is only used to gate
the `/canary` skill invocation (which itself decides how aggressively to probe the live URL).

## Inputs

Environment:

- `TICKET` — Linear identifier (e.g. `CTL-451`). Required.
- `WORKER_DIR` — directory containing `phase-monitor-merge.json` (read, primary input) and where
  `phase-monitor-deploy.json` (write) lands. Defaults to `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}` if set,
  else `$(pwd)`.
- `PHASE_DEPLOY_TIMEOUT_SEC` — seconds to wait for a `deployment_status` event matching the merge
  SHA. Default `1800` (30 minutes). Setting to a small value is the documented way to skip deploy
  verification in test/dev environments.
- `PHASE_DEPLOY_ENV` — GitHub Deployment environment name to match (default `production`). Set
  per-project as needed.
- `PHASE_CANARY_CMD` — command line used to invoke the canary skill. Default
  `claude --model haiku -p /canary --output-format json`. Test runners override this with a stub
  that emits a fixture canary result.
- `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID`, `CATALYST_SESSION_ID` — used for event trace/span id derivation.

`gh` CLI on `$PATH`, authenticated against the GitHub repo, is required only when
`phase-monitor-merge.json` exists but `.pr.mergeCommitSha` is empty (the REST fallback path). In the
common case (where `phase-monitor-merge` recorded the SHA successfully), `gh` is not invoked. The
fallback also reads PR number from `phase-pr.json`.

## phase-monitor-merge.json contract (input shape)

```json
{
  "pr": {
    "mergedAt": "2026-05-18T22:00:00Z",
    "ciStatus": "merged",
    "mergeCommitSha": "abc123..."
  }
}
```

The skill reads `.pr.mergeCommitSha` only; everything else is informational. The file is written by
[[phase-monitor-merge]] after `gh pr merge --squash` confirms via REST
(`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<num>` returns `.merged == true`).

## /goal

```
/goal "The deploy for the merge SHA actually SUCCEEDED — a terminal
       deployment_status success event arrived for the SHA AND the /canary check
       passed — and I have written ${WORKER_DIR}/phase-monitor-deploy.json
       recording that success. If the deploy FAILED (a deployment_status failure
       or a failing canary), I have driven at least one remediation attempt
       rather than passively recording failed/skipped. OR no deployment_status
       event arrived within PHASE_DEPLOY_TIMEOUT_SEC and I have recorded
       status:skipped with a reason (the PR is already merged, so a missing
       deploy event is a skip, not a failure)."
```

CTL-656: monitor-deploy is **not** a passive watch — its goal is that the deploy _actually
succeeded_, so the `/goal` evaluator keeps the agent driving toward a green canary, including a
remediation attempt on a failed deploy, instead of emitting `failed`/`skipped` and walking away on
the first terminal signal. The timeout path is the one legitimate early exit. (Production mode only;
the CI bash body below remains self-sufficient and deterministic.)

## What an Opus-mode invocation adds

Haiku is the default. If the orchestrator routes this to an Opus agent (e.g., for a high-stakes
deploy where the canary is borderline), the agent should:

1. Run the bash body to drive the deploy event wait + canary invocation.
2. Read `canary-output.json` and decide whether the canary result is materially actionable beyond
   the binary `status` field (e.g., performance regressions worth flagging).
3. Optionally extend the comment posted by a later phase agent with model-grade insight.

The bash body alone is enough to drive the state machine. Opus-mode add-ons are pure upside.
