// reconcile-health.mjs — per-team reconcile-health tracking + escalation (CTL-867).
//
// The bug: when a team's eligibleQuery errors every reconcile poll (e.g. its
// status references a removed Linear state → `linearis issues list --team X
// --status Ready` exits 1), reconcileProject's catch preserves the prior
// eligible set and logs `reconcile poll failed — preserving prior eligible set`.
// That is correct for a transient blip, but a PERSISTENT failure freezes the
// team's eligible projection stale for hours: no new Todo tickets ever become
// eligible, the daemon looks healthy, and the whole team starves invisibly.
//
// This module is the visibility fix. It tracks per-team reconcile health on the
// monitor (consecutive-failure count + last-successful-refresh timestamp),
// escalates a canonical `monitor.reconcile.failing.<TEAM>` event to the unified
// event log after N consecutive failures (so the orch-monitor dashboard surfaces
// the failing team), and clears the alert (emitting `monitor.reconcile.recovered
// .<TEAM>`) when a poll succeeds again. It also persists a per-team health marker
// file the orch-monitor server reads to render each team's "last successful
// eligible refresh age".
