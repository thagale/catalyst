// cluster-heartbeat-publisher.mjs — periodic cross-host liveness publisher
// (CTL-1090, Phase 4).
//
// startLivenessPublisher mirrors startHeartbeat() in heartbeat-event.mjs:
// immediate tick + setInterval + unref + { stop } handle. The difference:
//   • single-host (roster<=1) → inert { stop(){} } handle (no-op), unconditionally.
//   • multi-host: the anchor requirement and the Linear publish are both gated
//     on the ACTIVE read source (CTL-1420 #17 / CTL-1628), not on anchor
//     presence alone:
//       - readSource "linear" + no anchor configured → inert { stop(){} }
//         handle (the legacy no-op path).
//       - readSource "linear" + anchor configured → armed; each tick publishes
//         { anchorIssue, host: self, inFlightTickets: ownedTickets() } via
//         publishHeartbeatSync (fail-open — a publish error is swallowed),
//         AFTER the Linear-free fence re-emit below.
//       - readSource "loki" (anchor configured or not) → armed, but the Linear
//         anchor publish is skipped every tick (retired in this mode); only
//         the Linear-free CTL-863 fence re-emit runs.
//
// The `ownedTickets` default reads in-flight tickets for `self` from the LOCAL
// signal directory (same predicate defaultOwnedTicketsForHost uses for the
// fallback path), avoiding a circular dependency on recovery.mjs.
