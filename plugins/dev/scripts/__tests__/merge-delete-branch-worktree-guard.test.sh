# atomic `--delete-branch` deleted ONLY on a successful merge; the split rewrite must preserve
# that with an EXECUTABLE `.merged` confirm (not a prose comment) before the delete, or a
# failed/unconfirmed merge orphans the PR's head ref. Assert the confirm token exists at each
# merge+delete site. (CTL-56 Codex round-1 P1: merge-pr was previously excluded as "interactive and
# human-gated", but human-gating gates the merge DECISION, not the merge-queue race — with a queue,
# `gh pr merge` enqueues and returns success and the next line would delete a still-open PR's head
# ref. So merge-pr now carries the executable `.merged` gate too; recovery-pass carries its own
# cross-repo REST-confirm prose.)
