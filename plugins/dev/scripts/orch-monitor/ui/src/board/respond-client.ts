// respond-client.ts — THE write path of the calm Inbox home (CTL-903 / HOME5).
// This is the only MUTATING path in HOME and the payoff of the whole Inbox: one
// bright verb on a needs-you row both RECORDS the operator's response AND RESUMES
// the paused agent. It is a React-/jotai-/router-free module (same pattern as
// home-inbox.ts / reading-pane-model.ts) so the orch-monitor `bun test` suite can
// unit it directly from outside the `ui/` module graph; the React surface that
// owns the optimistic state + the grace timer renders THROUGH it.
//
// IT DOES NOT OWN A BACKEND. The resume loop is CTL-876 and the write endpoint is
// the BFF12 read-model mutation route POST /api/ticket/<ticket>/respond
// (server.ts → lib/respond-ticket.mjs), both already merged. This module is the
// WEB ENTRY POINT: it calls that endpoint, maps its discriminated result to a
// closed outcome the surface acts on, and carries the optimistic-rollback math.
//
// FENCE-AWARENESS (the cluster Gherkin) lives ENTIRELY server-side: the endpoint
// passes the held run's generation through the cross-host fence-check and a
// single-host host set (hosts.json absent / length 1) is an exact identity no-op
// pass (it returns `resuming` with `fenceNoop:true`, zero added latency). The
// client never reads hosts.json and adds no cluster code on the hot path — a
// verified-stale / unconfirmable fence simply arrives as a 409 we surface as a
// `rejected` outcome (the write did NOT act). That keeps the single-node MVP an
// exact pass-through while the multi-node rejection rides for free.
