#!/usr/bin/env bash
# health-responder.sh — Stateless periodic health responder for the supervised
# cloud-sync replica writer (CTL-1509). Complements catalyst-doctor (which only
# DETECTS) with a bounded, local ACT step: when the writer is dead or wedged,
# kickstart its LaunchAgent — at most N times per window — then escalate loudly
# and stop.
#
# Deliberately a SHORT-LIVED launchd StartInterval sweep (the orphan-sweep
# pattern), NOT a long-lived daemon: a watcher daemon can zombie in exactly the
# ways the daemons it guards do; a fresh process every interval cannot. All
# detection is LOCAL (plist / pgrep / lock-file mtime / breadcrumb file) —
# never Linear, never Loki — so the responder keeps working through exactly the
# outages it exists to respond to.
#
# Conditions (any one triggers the bounded kickstart):
#   1. dead-writer  — cloud-sync agent installed (plist on disk) but no
#                     cloud-sync.mjs process. KeepAlive={SuccessfulExit:false}
#                     should have relaunched a crashed writer; if it didn't,
#                     the job is wedged and a kickstart is the fix.
#   2. stale-writer — a cloud-sync.mjs process EXISTS but the writer.lock
#                     heartbeat (SDK rewrites it ~5s, feed-INDEPENDENT — a
#                     quiet Linear feed never stales the lock, only a dead SDK
#                     heartbeat does; see doctor.mjs checkCloudSync) is older
#                     than RESPONDER_LOCK_STALE_SECS. Doctor merely WARNs at
#                     60s (CATALYST_REPLICA_LOCK_STALE_MS); the responder ACTS
#                     only at 900s — the act-threshold is deliberately far
#                     above the detect-threshold so a jittery heartbeat is
#                     never kickstarted.
#   3. no-respawn   — the CTL-1508 self-heal breadcrumb
#                     (~/catalyst/cloud-sync.selfheal.json) says the writer
#                     exited ON PURPOSE expecting a launchd relaunch
#                     (expectRestart:true), but no process came back within
#                     RESPONDER_SELFHEAL_GRACE_SECS. Absent breadcrumb = the
#                     normal case (CTL-1508 ships in parallel); absent or
#                     malformed is silently ignored.
#
# Escalation contract: attempts are timestamped marker files under
# ~/catalyst/.health-responder/. When RESPONDER_MAX_ATTEMPTS kickstarts within
# RESPONDER_ATTEMPT_WINDOW_SECS have not cleared the condition, write the
# one-shot ESCALATED.cloud-sync marker, emit catalyst.responder.escalated
# (fail-open) + an ERROR log line (Alloy ships this log to Loki), and STOP
# kickstarting. The condition clearing (a healthy probe) removes the marker and
# the attempt files, re-arming the responder. Never crash-loops launchctl.
#
# Every run — healthy, acting, escalated, or disabled — ends with exactly one
# grep-stable heartbeat line ("heartbeat status=…"). The stale-copy-reports-
# healthy rule: a dead responder must be distinguishable from a quiet one, so
# silence in ~/catalyst/health-responder.log for > interval means the RESPONDER
# is down, not that everything is fine.
#
# Usage:
#   health-responder.sh [--dry-run] [--help]
#
# A SECOND supervised target rides the same sweep (CTL-1518): the
# com.catalyst.agent host-metrics sampler (it died on mini-2 and launchd left it
# dead for 10 days). Its block runs BEFORE the cloud-sync detect — the cloud-sync
# act path `exit 0`s at several points, so a block after it is unreachable — and
# is fully inert on nodes without the agent plist. Staleness is the age of the
# agent's breadcrumb (~/catalyst/catalyst-agent.heartbeat, refreshed each --once
# tick), falling back to the plist install-mtime when the breadcrumb is absent.
# Same bounded-kickstart + one-shot-escalation + re-arm contract, with its OWN
# agent-scoped markers / heartbeat line / OTel escalate.
#
# Env overrides (all have production defaults):

#
# Second supervised target: the com.catalyst.agent host-metrics sampler. It died
# on mini-2 and launchd left it dead for 10 days — this block is the code
# backstop for that class of silent death. Same bounded-kickstart + one-shot-
# escalation + re-arm contract as the cloud-sync path, but with its OWN agent-
# scoped attempt markers (agent-attempt.*), escalation marker (ESCALATED.
# catalyst-agent), heartbeat line (target=catalyst-agent), and OTel escalate — so
# the two targets never share an attempt budget or clobber each other's state.
#
# PLACEMENT is load-bearing: this runs BEFORE the cloud-sync detect because the
# cloud-sync ACT path terminates the script with `exit 0` at several points — a
# block placed after it would be unreachable. Running first, this block MUST NOT
# exit; it falls through to the cloud-sync detect, whose heartbeat stays the LAST
# line of every sweep (the doctor-freshness contract). It runs only after the
# sweep lock is held (this trap fires after acquisition), so the two targets
# share the same single-sweep reservation.
#
# CRITICAL (CTL-1510 lineage): agent_heartbeat / emit_agent_escalated are
# SELF-CONTAINED — they read ONLY agent-scoped vars plus globals set at the top
# of the file. They deliberately do NOT call heartbeat() / emit_escalated(),
# which reference cloud-sync globals (INSTALLED, ALIVE, C_DEAD, CONDITIONS_CSV,
# ATTEMPTS, …) that are UNSET here under `set -u`; calling them would abort the
# sweep before the EXIT trap runs and leak the sweep lock. And every `$(...)`
# capture below is a single-line single command — NO comments inside a
# command-substitution capture (the bash 3.2 parser defect that cost CTL-1513 a
# production incident; the real interpreter is /bin/bash 3.2 via launchd/cron).
