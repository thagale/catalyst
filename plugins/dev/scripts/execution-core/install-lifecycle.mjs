// install-lifecycle.mjs — CTL-1369 PR3: the `catalyst install | uninstall | reinstall`
// per-class lifecycle driver (run via the thin `catalyst-install` bash launcher).
//
// It is a THIN ORCHESTRATOR, not a re-implementation of provisioning. It (a) composes the
// existing setup scripts per node class and (b) drives the PR1 `InstallRun` telemetry contract
// so each lifecycle run is an observable trace + a `catalyst.install.*` event stream.
//
// The composition surface (each step shells out; every path is an env-override SEAM so tests
// stub them — mirrors catalyst-join.sh's CATALYST_JOIN_*_SCRIPT pattern):
//   - setup-plugin-source.sh   (acquire)      clone/update the plugin checkout + register pluginDirs
//   - catalyst-backup backup   (backup)       snapshot restorable state BEFORE any overwrite
//   - catalyst class <x>       (write-config)  set Layer-2 node.class
//   - setup-catalyst.sh        (write-config)  Layer-1 config + Layer-2 secrets
//   - install-cli.sh           (install-agents) install the catalyst-* symlinks
//   - catalyst-stack install-services | adopt-updater (install-agents) — THE PER-CLASS SPLIT
//   - catalyst-stack start | catalyst drain  (start-daemons)
//   - catalyst-stack verify-node (healthcheck) class-aware health (NON-fatal)
//
// THE PER-CLASS INVARIANT (the heart of correctness, enforced by tests):
//   * worker     → runs `install-services` (broker/exec-core/monitor); NEVER `adopt-updater`
//                  (the broker is the plugin-pull owner).
//   * developer  → runs `adopt-updater` (5th updater agent, sole pull owner) + boot-drain;
//                  NEVER `install-services` (a developer node must not run broker/exec-core).
//   * monitor    → enum-slot stub: developer-shaped (updater + drain), no work stack (design §10).
//
// Phase enums are LOCKED with OTEL (it sized dashboards on {operation, phase}). install uses the
// PR1 INSTALL_PHASES; uninstall/reinstall finalized here. Telemetry is best-effort throughout —
// it must never break a lifecycle run. Provisioning failures roll back from the backup bundle.

  catalyst-install uninstall [--force] [--dry-run]
  catalyst-install reinstall [--class …] [--read-replica <url>] [--executor bg|sdk|oneshot-legacy] [--force] [--dry-run]

Options:
  --class <c>          target node class (install: declares it; un/reinstall: defaults to current)
  --read-replica <url> developer/monitor: a worker monitor's base URL to read from (e.g. http://host:7400)
  --executor <e>       durably provision the daemon executor (bg|sdk|oneshot-legacy) into
                       execution-core.env; omit to leave the node's existing executor untouched
  --force              teardown a live, non-drained node (uninstall/reinstall guard override)
  --dry-run, --print   resolve + print the per-class step plan; run NOTHING (no side effects)
  --json               machine-readable output (with --dry-run, prints the plan as JSON)
  -h, --help           this help

Per class: worker runs the full work stack (install-services); developer/monitor run the updater
agent (adopt-updater) + boot-drain and never start broker/exec-core.`;
