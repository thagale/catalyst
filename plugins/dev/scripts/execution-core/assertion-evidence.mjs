// assertion-evidence.mjs — CTL-1789. Who asserted that a phase finished?
//
// A phase signal reaching a terminal SUCCESS status (`done`, or `skipped` on
// monitor-deploy) is the ONLY input the scheduler's advancement FSM keys off.
// Three structurally different producers can write that terminal, and until this
// module existed they were byte-indistinguishable on disk:
//
//   A. the phase agent ran its own `phase-agent-emit-complete` wrapper
//      → the agent DECLARED it finished.
//   B. `flipSignalDoneOnSuccess` flipped an in-flight signal to `done` because
//      the SDK/codex query exited cleanly — WITHOUT the agent ever declaring
//      anything (sdk-run-phase-agent.mjs).
//   C. a recovery/revive path inferred completion from a work-done probe and
//      invoked the same wrapper on the dead worker's behalf.
//
// B and C are FABRICATED terminals: infrastructure asserting on the agent's
// behalf. They are legitimate (they are what keeps a pipeline moving past a
// crashed worker) but they are NOT the agent's own claim, and an audit that
// cannot tell them apart cannot answer "how much of this pipeline actually ran".
//
// `assertedBy` is the one-string marker every terminal-success writer now stamps
// onto the signal file. This module owns the vocabulary and the classifier.
//
// ZERO-IMPORT LEAF, deliberately (same discipline as lib/secret-contract.mjs):
// no node builtins, no sibling modules. `catalyst doctor`'s bare-node runtime,
// the bash-adjacent test harness, and the scheduler all consume it without
// dragging in config.mjs's bun:sqlite graph.
//
// SEMANTIC WARNING for downstream consumers: `assertedBy` records WHO WROTE THE
// TERMINAL, not whether the work was really done. A phase agent that runs its
// wrapper without doing anything useful still classifies as `declared`. The axis
// is declared-by-agent vs fabricated-by-infrastructure — nothing more.

// ASSERTED_BY — the registered writer ids. One per terminal-success writer.
//
// THIS IS THE ONLY SOURCE. JS writers (recovery.mjs, sdk-run-phase-agent.mjs)
// import these symbols. The two BASH writers cannot — `phase-agent-emit-complete`
// hard-codes PHASE_AGENT as its --asserted-by default and `orchestrate-revive`
// hard-codes REVIVE_SYNTHESIZED — so those mirrors are held honest MECHANICALLY
// by assertion-evidence-parity.test.mjs, which extracts each bash literal and
// compares it to the row here. Renaming EITHER side alone fails that suite; an
// undetected drift would silently reclassify a valid declared/fabricated
// terminal as absent/unknown-writer and corrupt the advancement audit. Same
// discipline as lib/secret-contract.mjs and its bash mirror. CTL-1789 P2.
