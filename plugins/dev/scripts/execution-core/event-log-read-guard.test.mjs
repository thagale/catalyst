// event-log-read-guard.test.mjs — CTL-1529 regression guard.
//
// INVARIANT: no source file in the scanned trees may whole-file-read a path that
// resolves to an append-only JSONL log — the monthly event log above all.
//
// SCOPE, stated precisely. Rounds 1 and 2 both hardcoded a directory list and
// both overstated it; round 3 replaces the list with a walk of the whole tree so
// the claim below is what the code does, by construction:
//   • SCANNED: the ENTIRE plugins/dev/scripts tree — every non-test
//     .mjs/.ts/.js at any depth, whether it runs in a daemon or in a short-lived
//     CLI. Round 2's list named 4 of 16 directories; `otel-forward` — a
//     long-lived daemon whose whole job is reading the event log — was among the
//     12 omitted. A NEW directory is in scope the day it is created; there is no
//     list to forget to update.
//   • NOT SCANNED (SKIP_DIRS, each with a reason at the declaration):
//     orch-monitor/ui (browser code, no fs), __tests__/ and *.test.*
//     (short-lived processes), fixtures, db-migrations (.sql), node_modules.
//   • The invariant is about the READ SHAPE, not about process lifetime. A CLI
//     that legitimately needs the whole file is allowlisted WITH that argument
//     written down (see lib/scrub-test-events.mjs) rather than silently exempt.
//   • The scan is a heuristic with NAMED, TESTED blind spots — see "LIMITS"
//     above `eventLogTaintedNames`. Passing this test means "no violation of the
//     shapes the detector can see", not "no whole-file read exists anywhere".
//
// The log is 883 MB on the busiest host; a `readFileSync(path, "utf8")` of it
// costs ~1.9 s of blocked event loop AND allocates one giant contiguous buffer
// that bun/mimalloc never returns to the OS (the mechanism behind exec-core
// sitting at ~3.25 GB RSS of 16 GB). Bounded readers exist — this test is what
// stops the next one from being written by hand.
//
// SHAPE: a source scan modeled on broker/namespace-parity.test.mjs, using
// SNAPSHOT-SET EQUALITY rather than a "no new violations" check. Set equality
// fails in BOTH directions: a new whole-file read fails (the point), and a FIXED
// site also fails until its stale allowlist entry is deleted — which is what keeps
// the allowlist from rotting into a permanent amnesty list.
//
// Every exemption must carry BOTH an allowlist entry with a real `reason` AND an
// in-source `// EVENT-LOG-FULL-READ-OK(<TICKET>): <why>` marker, so the exemption
// is visible at the code and no one can self-exempt by sprinkling the marker.
//
// Approved bounded readers to migrate toward:
//   execution-core/event-tail.mjs   scanEventsSince   (time-covering tail + coverage verdict)
//                                   scanEventsChunked (forward fold, bounded memory)
//                                   tailParsedEvents  (last-N events)
//   orch-monitor/lib/event-log-reader.ts  scanFileLines (forward, bounded memory)

// WHY THIS EXISTS. Round 1 of this guard matched only the ARGUMENT TEXT of the
// read: `getEventLogPath()`, a literal `.jsonl`, or one of four known variable
// names. That is exactly the shape a real, live, 344 MB whole-log read did NOT
// have, and it shipped inside this very PR:
//
//     private monthlyFilePath(d: Date): string {
//       return join(this.baseDir, `${y}-${m}.jsonl`);   // ← the event log
//     }
//     ...
//     const path = this.monthlyFilePath(this.now());
//     this.maybeRotateLegacy(path);                     // ← param `filePath`
//     ...
//     function isLegacyFirstLine(filePath: string) {
//       content = readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");       // ← INVISIBLE to round 1
//
// The argument is an opaque `filePath` three hops from anything spelled like the
// event log, so an argument-text matcher cannot see it — and a missed instance
// is a silent 344 MB read. So the scan now follows values within the module:
//
//   SEED       an identifier assigned from an EVENT_LOG_EXPR
//   RETURN     a function whose `return` is an EVENT_LOG_EXPR (or tainted) —
//              the FUNCTION NAME becomes a producer
//   ASSIGN     an identifier assigned from a tainted identifier / producer call
//   PARAM-BIND a call passing a tainted identifier taints the callee's Nth
//              parameter name
//
// …to a fixpoint. Taint is keyed by NAME and is MODULE-GLOBAL — deliberately
// over-approximate, per the review's instruction to prefer allowlistable false
// positives over silent false negatives. Two exclusions keep that
// over-approximation from drowning the allowlist, and BOTH are facts about the
// data rather than conveniences:
//
//   • `JSON.parse(readFileSync(x))` — a JSONL log is line-delimited, so parsing
//     the WHOLE file as one JSON value can only ever throw. Such a site is
//     provably reading a single-object file (state.json, config.json). This
//     exclusion applies ONLY to the taint branch; an explicitly-spelled
//     event-log argument is still reported.
//   • a `Bun.file()` handle that is never awaited as `.text()/.json()/…` — it is
//     a lazy descriptor (e.g. handed to `new Response(file)`, which streams).
//
// LIMITS — the blind spots, MEASURED not assumed (round 3). Each of these is
// pinned by a test in "detector LIMITS — the known blind spots are pinned"
// below, so this list cannot drift from the code the way the header's scope
// claim did in rounds 1 and 2. If you widen the detector, that test goes RED
// and you must delete the entry here in the same commit.
//
//   1. ONE-LINE CLASS-METHOD BODIES — `logFile() { return \`${y}.jsonl\`; }`.
//      FN_PATTERNS[2] anchors the method header with `\{\s*$`, so a method whose
//      whole body is on the header line never enters the function table and
//      `enclosingFn` cannot attribute its `return` to anything. (One-line
//      FUNCTION bodies and inline `if (x) return …` guards ARE caught — that is
//      the round-3 producer-rule fix directly above the `ret` regex.)
//   2. ARRAY hops — `const paths = [target]; readFileSync(paths[0])`.
//   3. OBJECT-PROPERTY hops — `const cfg = { path: target }; readFileSync(cfg.path)`.
//   4. `for…of` binding — `for (const f of [target]) readFileSync(f)`.
//   5. ALIASED READ FUNCTIONS — `const slurp = readFileSync; slurp(target)`.
//      READ_CALL matches the three real API names, not an alias of one.
//   6. CROSS-MODULE helpers — taint is per-file, so a path produced in module A
//      and read through a plainly-named parameter in module B is invisible.
//      Two live instances, both handled by hand rather than by the scan:
//        • `orch-monitor/analyze-events.ts` (glob → array → object property →
//          parameter → `for…of`, i.e. limits 2+3+4+6 at once) — bounded by hand.
//        • `otel-forward/lib/dlq.ts` — the DLQ path is built in `index.ts`
//          (`join(CATALYST_DIR, "…-dlq-otlp.jsonl")`) and read through a bare
//          `dlqPath` parameter. Caught today ONLY because `dlqPath` was added to
//          the known-name list below, not by the dataflow.
//   7. COMPOSITE ARGUMENTS — `argIsEventLog` requires a BARE identifier and never
//      consults the `producers` set, so a producer INLINED into the read is
//      invisible while the same producer via a local IS caught:
//        `readFileSync(monthlyLogPath())`, `readFileSync(await p())`,
//        `readFileSync(wrap(taintedId))`,
//        `readFileSync(target ?? fallback)`.
//      This is the most natural-looking of all the gaps — the codebase's own
//      idiom (`readChannelFile(channelPath(…))`, `monthlyLogPath(…)`) sits
//      exactly here, so treat a NEW inlined-producer read as unprotected.
//      MEASURED EXCEPTION: an inlined METHOD producer — `readFileSync(this.logPath())`
//      with a multi-line method body — IS caught. It was in a draft of this list
//      and removed after the pinning fixture went red; the list must not
//      over-claim blindness any more than it may over-claim coverage.
//   8. `getPrevMonthEventLogPath()` — the getEventLogPath special case is
//      anchored to the ZERO-ARG spelling of that one name, so the prior-month
//      accessor (the same file class) misses on every axis.
//   9. TS GENERIC METHOD HEADERS — `logFile<T>() {` never enters the function
//      table, so its `return` is unattributable (same mechanism as limit 1).
//
// NOT a limit, though an earlier draft of this list said it was: RE-EXPORTED
// CLOSURES. `function make() { return () => \`${y}.jsonl\`; }` and a closure that
// captures a tainted local and reads it are BOTH caught (measured; pinned in
// "closures are NOT a blind spot" below). The claim was removed rather than left
// standing — an overstated LIMITS list is the same defect as an overstated scope
// claim, just pointing the other way.
