# lib/phase-artifact-gate.sh — shared phase-artifact gate contract (CTL-1081).
#
# Exposes three functions:
#   prior_artifact_for_phase <phase>
#       Gate spec for the artifact the PRIOR phase produces (consumer view).
#       Returns "signal:<file>", "glob:<dir>", or "" (entry point).
#
#   own_thoughts_artifact_dir_for_phase <phase>
#       Directory where THIS phase writes its thoughts artifact (producer view).
#       Returns a directory path ("thoughts/shared/research", etc.) or "".
#
#   match_thoughts_artifact <dir> <ticket>
#       Slug-tolerant, boundary-safe, case-insensitive matcher.
#       Prints matching filenames; returns 0 if at least one match, 1 otherwise.
#       Bash-3.2 safe (no mapfile, no ${var,,}).
#
# Source this file; do NOT execute it. It has no side-effects on sourcing.

# Guard against double-sourcing.

#   "glob:<dir>"     → a thoughts artifact under <dir>/ (evaluated via match_thoughts_artifact)
#   ""               → this phase is the pipeline entry point (no prior artifact)
