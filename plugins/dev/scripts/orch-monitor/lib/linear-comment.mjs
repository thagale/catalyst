// linear-comment.mjs — post a REAL Linear comment, authored as the OPERATOR
// (CTL-1569 §4). This is the module the whole feature lives or dies on.
//
// ── why this is the sharpest edge in the ticket ───────────────────────────────
// CTL-1567 made a human comment on a parked ticket clear `needs-human`
// unconditionally and first. That is what makes "reply from the inbox" a real
// resolution mechanism rather than a UI gesture. But that gate requires a
// POSITIVELY-IDENTIFIED HUMAN author, and it deliberately IGNORES app-actor
// comments — that guard exists because the escalation itself posts an explanatory
// comment as the app, and without the guard the bot would clear the very label it
// had just applied.
//
// The consequence: **a reply posted as the app actor silently does nothing.** The
// comment appears in Linear, the UI looks correct, the row even disappears
// optimistically — and the ticket stays parked forever. It is the single easiest
// way to ship this feature completely inert, and it fails SILENTLY, which is the
// worst possible failure shape.
//
// So this module does not merely *hope* it holds the right token. It RESOLVES the
// token's identity and REFUSES to post as a bot:
//
//   1. Resolve `viewer` for the token actually in hand.
//   2. If that identity is an app/bot actor — or matches a configured
//      `botUserId` — REFUSE with `status:"bot_identity"` and post NOTHING.
//   3. Only then post, and return the authorship the server observed.
//
// Refusing loudly is strictly better than posting a comment that cannot resolve
// the ask: the operator sees "this would not have worked" and the row is RESTORED
// (the §4 failure-path requirement), instead of believing they answered.
//
// ── token provenance ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The personal `lin_api_*` key in the monitor's env resolves to the human operator
// (verified: → Ryan Rozich / a real Linear user). The DAEMON is the process that
// swaps in an app-actor OAuth token (catalyst-execution-core mints
// client_credentials with `actor=app` and exports LINEAR_API_TOKEN into the
// daemon's own env only). The monitor is a separate process and inherits the
// personal key — but "inherits" is an assumption about process env, exactly the
// kind that rots silently across a deploy or a launchd change. Hence the runtime
// check above rather than a comment asserting it is fine.
//
// Writes go through the Linear GraphQL API directly (not `linearis`): `linearis`
// has no "post a comment" verb this path can use without shelling per keystroke,
// and CTL-1569's own note records that `linearis --label-mode overwrite` returns a
// success payload while silently not applying — the GraphQL path is the one that
// demonstrably works for mutations. Reads stay on the replica (linear-thread.mjs).

/**
 * Every place a personal Linear token might be configured, in priority order,
 * deduplicated, empty/falsy entries dropped.
 *
 * ── why this cannot be env-only ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An env-only resolver makes this feature INERT on the normal persistent launch
 * path. `catalyst-monitor.sh` (the committed launchd wrapper) exports no Linear
 * token at all; the operator's personal token lives in the Layer-2 secrets file
 * `~/.config/catalyst/config-<projectKey>.json` under `linear.apiToken`. So a
 * launchd-started monitor would return `no_token` for every inline reply even
 * though Linear is fully configured — the same class of silent no-op the
 * authorship gate exists to prevent, arriving through a different door.
 *
 * ── why the FIRST non-empty candidate is not good enough either (2026-08-02) ──
 * `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`/`LINEAR_API_KEY` are not exclusively a personal-token slot:
 * `lib/linear-app-actor.sh` exports the APP-ACTOR's own OAuth token into these
 * exact two names for any daemon (broker/execution-core/monitor) that needs bot
 * credentials for its normal automated reads/writes — a monitor process that also
 * sources that script (as fixed for the CAT-1 liveness dashboard) will ALWAYS
 * have a non-empty `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`, but it is the bot's, not a human's. The
 * old "first non-empty string wins" resolver stopped right there and never even
 * looked at Layer-2 config, so a correctly-configured personal `linear.apiToken`
 * was permanently unreachable on such a host — not a missing-config problem, an
 * unreachable-config one. `postOperatorComment` below now walks EVERY candidate
 * this function returns and identity-checks each one, so a bot-shaped env value
 * no longer shadows a genuine personal token sitting in config.
 *
 * Order: env `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` → env `LINEAR_API_KEY` → Layer-2 `linear.apiToken`
 * → Layer-2 `catalyst.linear.apiToken` (BOTH config shapes are accepted —
 * `linear.apiToken` is what the reference schema documents
 * (website/.../reference/configuration.md) and what real installs carry, while
 * the nested `catalyst.linear.apiToken` shows up in some setups; reading only one
 * shape means a validly-configured host can still resolve nothing).
 *
 * ── the one credential we must NEVER include ─────────────────────────────────
 * The same Layer-2 file also carries `catalyst.linear.agent.accessToken` — an
 * APP-ACTOR OAuth token. Reaching for it would post the reply as the app, which
 * CTL-1567's provenance gate ignores, making the reply silently do nothing. It is
 * deliberately NOT in this list. (The authorship gate would catch it anyway if it
 * somehow got resolved to a human-looking viewer; this is the belt to that brace.)
