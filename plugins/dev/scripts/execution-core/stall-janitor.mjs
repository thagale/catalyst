// stall-janitor.mjs — CTL-1004 terminal-state leftover collapser.
//
// The orchestrator accumulates two classes of terminal-state leftovers that the
// event-driven reaper never names:
//   J1 (orphaned worktrees): teardown=done + .terminal-done.applied, the worktree
//       still on disk, no live session inside it, clean tree, CTL-791 evidence —
//       but the session already exited, so the 600s timer's UNTARGETED
//       orphans.reap-requested never names it. The janitor emits a TARGETED
//       orphans.reap-requested{ticket, worktree_path, bg_job_id}; the REAPER owns
//       removal (the targeted removal path + CTL-791 evidence gates).
//   J2 (ghost sessions): a terminal signal present >=600s with an idle background
//       session for the same subject. The janitor's kill seam (injected
//       recordKillIntent) BOTH issues the stop via killBgJob AND records a
//       kill-INTENT pinned to that bgJobId — mirroring recovery.mjs intentAwareKill.
//       The intent is recorded so the reconciler can VERIFY the session left the
//       agents listing next tick (and the CTL-936 retry bookkeeping stays
//       consistent), but the JANITOR — not the reconciler — performs the stop
//       (the reconciler is a postcondition verifier, never an executor).
//
// DOCTRINE (rules DERIVE, executors ACT; shadow-then-gate):
//   * The janitor only collapses already-terminal, UNAMBIGUOUS states. It never
//     calls deriveAdvancement, resolves conflicts, or infers liveness.
//   * J1 makes NO external writes — it emits a TARGETED reap event and lets the
//     REAPER (executor) remove the worktree. J2, by contrast, IS the executor for
//     the ghost-session stop: its kill seam issues killBgJob directly (the
//     reconciler only VERIFIES the stop landed, it never performs one). CTL-863
//     multi-host fences live in the reaper.
//   * SHADOW-FIRST: in "shadow" it emits janitor.would.* events and mutates
//     nothing (no reap event, no kill, no intent); in "enforce" it emits the real
//     targeted reap and issues the real ghost-session kill (+ pinned intent); in
//     "off" the whole pass is skipped (no census, no events).
//
// Split mirrors the CTL-729 watchdog: a PURE decision (classifyOrphanWorktree /
// classifyGhostSession — all evidence injected, no IO) + an action driver
// (runStallJanitorPass — every side-effect seam injected).
