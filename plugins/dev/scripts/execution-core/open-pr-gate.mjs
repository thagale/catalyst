// open-pr-gate.mjs — CTL-1157 open-PR ENUMERATOR (single source of truth).
//
// "Which open/unmerged PRs does this ticket still have?" — the FACTS that the
// senior-engineer recovery-pass delegate reads before it declares a ticket Done,
// and that the two pure-code backstops (scheduler.mjs `terminalDoneOnce`, the
// reconciler drain) consult to decide whether to fire the
// `recovery.done-applied-with-open-pr` alarm.
//
// THE REVERSAL (owner's decision): this module does NOT refuse a write. It is a
// data source, not a mechanical block. The earlier fail-closed "gate that refuses"
// behavior was the handcuff that got removed — the delegate is a senior engineer
// with autonomy: it enumerates the open PRs and reasons about EACH (finish/merge
// the ones that are part of the solution; CLOSE the abandoned/superseded ones
// itself), THEN marks Done. The hard block is held in reserve. Callers DECIDE what
// to do with this list.
//
// Authoritative open-state source is GitHub (`gh`), NEVER the local cache — a
// cache lag must never misreport a PR as merged. The ticket's branchName (the
// "non-standard branch" net) and its Linear ATTACHMENTS (linked PRs) are read from
// the local Catalyst-Cloud REPLICA/cache via `catalyst-linear read`
// (source:replica) — NEVER bare `linearis` (rate-limited; stalls the fleet).
//
// Returns { ok:true,  prs:[] }                          when no unmerged PR remains
//         { ok:false, prs:[…] }                         when ≥1 open PR exists
//         { ok:false, unverifiable:true, reason, prs }  when the authoritative GitHub
//           check could NOT be completed — a `gh` list/view failure, OR the ticket's
//           repo could not be derived (so we refuse to run gh in the wrong repo).
//           UNVERIFIABLE ≠ CLEAN: an unverifiable authoritative check is never a clean
//           list. Callers/backstops MUST treat it as "could not confirm zero open PRs"
//           — surface it / fire the alarm — and never assume an empty list. (`prs` may
//           carry the PRs discovered before the failure; the load-bearing field is
//           `unverifiable`.)
// `ok` is ADVISORY ("are there zero open PRs?"), retained for back-compat with
// callers/tests; it no longer implies any refusal.
