## After a reboot

Run once after each reboot to bring the stack up:

```bash
catalyst-stack start
```

That's it. The command is idempotent — already-running services are skipped. Check what's running at any time with:

```bash
catalyst-stack status
```

### Auto-start on boot (unattended)

To skip the manual step entirely — so a reboot never leaves the fleet (and the
dashboard) down — install a launchd LaunchAgent that runs `catalyst-stack start`
at login and keeps it alive:

```bash
catalyst-stack install-services
```

This writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.coalesce.catalyst-stack.plist` and loads
it. The agent runs `catalyst-stack start` at login (`RunAtLoad`) and again every
10 minutes as an idempotent keep-alive — because `start` is ordered
(monitor → broker → execution-core) and no-ops a running daemon, it never
double-starts, self-heals a daemon that crashed between intervals, and honors a deliberate
`catalyst-stack stop`. A direct `catalyst-stack start` resumes a deliberately halted stack. Output
goes to `~/catalyst/stack-launchd.log`. (`install-services` also installs two
companion agents — `catalyst-thoughts-sync`, which keeps your thoughts checkouts
fresh, and `catalyst-log-shipper` — so `services-status` lists three agents; see
the [catalyst-stack reference](/reference/catalyst-stack/).)

```bash
catalyst-stack install-services --interval 300   # change the keep-alive cadence (seconds)
catalyst-stack install-services --print          # preview the plist without installing
catalyst-stack services-status                   # is the agent installed + loaded?
catalyst-stack uninstall-services                # unload + remove (leaves running daemons up)
```

Because it is a per-user LaunchAgent (not a root LaunchDaemon), it starts at
**login** — on a headless Mac, enable automatic login so it fires on boot. macOS
only. Install it on every host that should run the fleet (laptop + mini).

> Pairs with the bg-worker reaper fix — only enable auto-start once reaping is
> bounded, or a freshly-booted box just refills the leak.

## Plugin source checkout

Workers run their plugin code (skills, scripts, agents) from a dedicated
**pristine, main-only checkout** of the catalyst repo — registered as
`catalyst.orchestration.pluginDirs` and resolved by `phase-agent-dispatch` when
it builds each worker's `--plugin-dir` flags. Keeping the source on a clean,
single-branch `main` checkout (separate from any worktree you develop in) means
updates are a simple `git pull --ff-only` and there is never local drift between
what you edit and what workers execute.

Provision it once:

```bash
plugins/dev/scripts/setup-plugin-source.sh
```

This clones the repo (main, single-branch) to `~/catalyst/plugin-source` and
registers `~/catalyst/plugin-source/plugins/dev` as `pluginDirs` in your machine
config. Choose a different location with `--path DIR` (or
`$CATALYST_PLUGIN_SOURCE`). Re-running is idempotent: it ff-only pulls the
existing checkout and leaves an already-correct registration untouched (use
`--force` to point `pluginDirs` at a new path).

The script **refuses** to register a linked git worktree or a checkout on any
branch other than `main` — the plugin source must be pristine so the unattended
ff-only auto-pull always succeeds.

Keep it fresh with `catalyst-stack hotpatch` (below) — and the broker auto-refreshes it on every
merge to `main`, plus a 5-minute drift-check backstop. That refresh is a
`git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/main` (**not** an ff-only pull — that is what `hotpatch`
does). `catalyst-stack parity` flags it as drift if the checkout ever ends up off `main` or becomes
a linked worktree.

:::caution[This checkout is deploy-only — do your editing in a worktree]
`~/catalyst/plugin-source` is a deployment target the broker keeps pinned to `origin/main`. Do
hands-on development in a git worktree (`/catalyst-dev:create-worktree`), not here.

Since CAT-167 the broker **refuses** to reset a checkout with uncommitted **tracked** changes: it
emits `plugin.checkout.dirty_skipped` (WARN) each tick and escalates to `plugin.checkout.dirty_stale`
(ERROR) after 30 minutes. Commit or stash to unblock it; the next eligible tick pulls. Untracked
files never block a refresh (`reset --hard` does not delete them). Set
`CATALYST_PLUGIN_DIRTY_GUARD=off` to restore the old unconditional-reset behavior.
:::

## After merging or pulling new code

The fastest way to refresh the plugin-source checkout and restart:

```bash
catalyst-stack restart --hotpatch
```

This does two things in sequence:

1. `git pull --ff-only origin main` in each `pluginDirs` checkout (resolved via
   `lib/plugin-dirs.sh`: `CATALYST_PLUGIN_DIRS` env → repo `.catalyst/config.json`
   → machine config). It refuses dirty or diverged checkouts and emits a
   `node.checkout.updated` event recording the old → new commit.
2. Stops and restarts the stack.

If the pull fails (non-fast-forward), the command aborts before restarting.
Resolve the conflict manually, then retry.

> `catalyst-stack hotpatch --legacy-rsync` and is deprecated — migrate the node
> to the one-checkout model above.

## Debugging Linear API rate-limiting (mitmproxy, opt-in)

The mitmproxy audit is **off by default** and is a rare diagnostic tool — use it for a short window
when you need to inspect Linear API traffic or rate-limit headers, then turn it off.

**Turn ON:**

```bash
catalyst-stack restart --proxy
```

**Turn OFF:**

```bash
catalyst-stack restart
```

On first use, `catalyst-stack --proxy` installs mitmproxy via `brew install mitmproxy` if absent,
generates the CA cert, and copies the vendored addon to `~/catalyst/mitm_linear_addon.py`. Traffic
is written to `~/catalyst/linear-proxy.jsonl`.

The proxy vars (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `NO_PROXY`) are
injected only as an inline env prefix for the daemon process — they are never written to disk and
disappear on the next plain `catalyst-stack restart`.

## Boot-resume guarantee

The execution-core daemon persists its work queue to disk. If you stop the stack in the middle of an autonomous run, the orchestrator resumes where it left off when you `catalyst-stack start` again.
