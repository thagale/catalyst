// fleet-freeze-alert.mjs — CTL-1420. A fleet-frozen-for-admission alert.
//
// When EVERY registered team's reconcile is in a persistent-failure (alerting)
// state at once, the eligible projection cannot be refreshed from either source:
// the local Linear replica is unavailable (stale/absent → the reader returns
// undefined) AND the live Linear API is unreachable (the CTL-679 breaker is
// pinned open). New work then cannot be admitted fleet-wide until one source
// recovers. The CTL-1420 surface-(a) fix keeps a FRESH replica serving during a
// quota storm, so this alert fires only for the residual DOUBLE outage (no fresh
// replica AND no quota) — which used to fail silently (reconcileProject just
// preserves the empty prior set). This makes it LOUD.
//
// Emits, mirroring reconcile-health-event.mjs (OTel envelope, appendFileSync,
// never throws), onto the SAME catalyst.alert.* topic the broker uses for its own
// alerts (broker/alert-emit.mjs), so the existing alert consumer picks it up:
//   catalyst.alert.raised   (event.label=fleet_frozen_admission, WARN)
//   catalyst.alert.cleared  (INFO)
// Attribution is catalyst.execution-core (the monitor observed the freeze),
// consistent with the "alerting decoupled via Loki" design and the established
// execution-core precedent (reconcile-health-event.mjs): emit intent to the
// unified event log; a separate consumer delivers. A distinct service.name (not
// catalyst.broker) also means the broker's own self-filter does not drop it.
