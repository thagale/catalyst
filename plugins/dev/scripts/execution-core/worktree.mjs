// worktree.mjs — execution-core git-worktree lifecycle (CTL-582).
//
// One worktree per ticket at ~/catalyst/wt/<projectKey>/<TICKET>, created on
// first dispatch and reused across all 9 phases. This module is the D9 worktree
// seam: create + teardown both flow through it, so a cloud executor swaps the
// worktree model at one place.

import { spawnSync } from "node:child_process";

// create-worktree.sh sits one directory up from execution-core/.

// createWorktree — run create-worktree.sh with cwd === repoRoot so the script
// resolves projectKey / worktreeDir from that repo's .catalyst/config.json.
// `--reuse-existing` makes it idempotent: the second…ninth phase of a ticket
// short-circuit to the existing worktree. Returns { code, worktreePath, stderr }
// — never throws. `worktreePath` is parsed from the trailing WORKTREE_PATH=
// line create-worktree.sh prints on a successful create and on the
// --reuse-existing short-circuit.
//
// CTL-615: when `expectedBranch` is supplied, the script's --reuse-existing
// short-circuit validates the existing worktree is on that branch and exits
// non-zero on mismatch. The daemon's revive path passes ticket as the
// expectedBranch so a project-key collision (~/catalyst/wt/CTL/CTL-T3
// pointing at a worktree checked out to ADV-1129) surfaces immediately
// instead of silently landing the redispatch in the wrong tree.

// It performs NO evidence gating; callers MUST funnel terminal removals through
// `safeTeardownWorktree` (worktree-safety.mjs), which checks GitHub-merged + clean
// + no-live-session + orchestrator-provenance and archives first. This export
// stays only as that gate's injected `removeWorktree` seam. Returns true when the
// worktree is gone (removed now, or already absent); false on a list/remove
// failure (incl. a `git worktree remove` refusal — which is the SAFE direction).
