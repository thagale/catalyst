description: |
  Phase agent for the review step of the 10-phase orchestrator pipeline (CTL-450).
  Wraps the /review skill (gstack) — explicitly skips /ultrareview per user decision.
  Reads verify.json from the prior phase, runs /review against the diff, writes
  ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/<TICKET>/review.json, and creates a remediation commit for
  any HIGH-severity finding that has a deterministic fix. MEDIUM/LOW findings are
  filed to a follow-up ticket per the PR review convergence policy (2026-08-07)
  instead of being silently dropped. Emits phase.review.complete.<ticket>.
  Spawned via phase-agent-dispatch via slash command — hence `user-invocable: true`.
user-invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: false  # invocable by model (Skill tool) AND user (slash command)
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Grep
  - Glob

# phase-review

You are the **review phase agent**. You run inside `claude --bg` and own a single
responsibility: pre-landing review of the worker branch using the gstack
[[review]] skill, producing `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/<TICKET>/review.json` and at most
one remediation commit. You then emit `phase.review.complete.<ticket>` and exit.
Built on the [[_phase-agent-template]] contract.

You **do not** invoke `/ultrareview` — that command is reserved for the user to
trigger interactively (it costs real money via the multi-agent cloud review).

## /goal

```
/goal "I have written ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/review.json with
       {findings:[...], remediationCommit:string|null, reviewPassed:bool} AND any
       HIGH-severity finding with a deterministic fix has a corresponding
       remediation commit on HEAD. I have printed the path on stdout."
```

## Work block

### 1. Run /review (gstack) — never /ultrareview

```text
Invoke the /review skill via the Task tool. It analyzes the diff against the base
branch for SQL safety, LLM trust boundary violations, conditional side effects,
and other structural issues. Capture its output as raw text and parse into the
review findings array.
```

DO NOT invoke `/ultrareview` from this phase. If a future iteration wants
multi-agent cloud review, the user runs it interactively before merge.

### 2. Merge findings from verify.json

The `findings` array in `verify.json` (from [[phase-verify]]) is the upstream
source of truth. Treat each verify finding as a candidate review item. This
phase runs once (it is not part of the iterative round loop the fleet's PR
review convergence policy governs — see [[review-comments]]'s Step 1.5 for
that policy's current round schedule, canonical as of
`docs/DECISIONS/2026-08-07-pr-review-convergence-policy.md`; this repo's own
incident history behind the schedule lives in
`docs/DECISIONS/2026-08-19-review-convergence-policy-update.md`), so it
applies the simplest end of that same policy unconditionally:

- HIGH severity (P1) + deterministic fix → remediation commit
- HIGH severity (P1) + ambiguous fix → record in `review.json` for human attention
- MEDIUM / LOW (P2-and-lower) → do not commit. File (or append to) one
  follow-up ticket for this PR — see "Filing the follow-up ticket" below —
  with the finding pasted verbatim (file:line, message). Record the ticket
  ID against the finding so `review-comments` can append to the same
  ticket instead of opening a new one on a later round.

The fix decision is deterministic when:

- The finding's `recommendation` is a single concrete code change with a clear
  before/after, AND
- The fix is local (no cross-file refactor), AND
- The fix doesn't change a public API or test expectation.

### Filing the follow-up ticket (P2-and-lower)

If any MEDIUM/LOW findings survive step 2, file (or append to) exactly one follow-up ticket for
this ticket/branch, using the target repo's normal ticket-authoring convention (`gherkin-ticket`
where Linear is used). Title: `[follow-up] ${TICKET} — deferred review findings`. Body: each
finding pasted verbatim, one per bullet, with file:line. This runs before the PR exists, so there
is no thread to reply to yet — `review-comments` (round 2+ on the opened PR) appends to this same
ticket rather than opening a new one; it discovers the existing ticket via `review.json`'s
`followUpTicket` field (below).

### 3. Create at most ONE remediation commit

If you make any code changes, batch them into a single commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(${ticket-scope}): phase-review remediations for ${TICKET}

Addresses HIGH-severity findings surfaced by phase-verify and /review:
- <one line per finding>

Refs: ${TICKET}"
```

Scope (`dev`/`pm`/`meta` etc.) comes from the project's existing convention; if
unclear, use `dev`. Never use `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign`.

### 4. Write the artifact

```bash
ARTIFACT="${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/review.json"
REMEDIATION_SHA=$(git log -1 --grep="phase-review remediations for ${TICKET}" \
  --format=%H 2>/dev/null || echo "")
REVIEW_PASSED=$([[ -z "$BLOCKING_FINDINGS" ]] && echo "true" || echo "false")

jq -nc \
  --argjson findings "$REVIEW_FINDINGS_JSON" \
  --arg sha "$REMEDIATION_SHA" \
  --argjson passed "$REVIEW_PASSED" \
  --arg followUpTicket "${FOLLOW_UP_TICKET:-}" \
  --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  '{findings: $findings,
    remediationCommit: (if $sha == "" then null else $sha end),
    followUpTicket: (if $followUpTicket == "" then null else $followUpTicket end),
    reviewPassed: $passed,
    generatedAt: $ts}' > "${ARTIFACT}.tmp" \
  && mv "${ARTIFACT}.tmp" "$ARTIFACT"
```

**Findings array shape** — each entry mirrors phase-verify's shape plus an
`addressedBy` field. `follow-up-ticket` is the P2-and-lower outcome from the
convergence policy above; `$FOLLOW_UP_TICKET`, once set, is also written at
the artifact's top level (`followUpTicket`) so `review-comments` can append
to the same ticket on a later round instead of opening a new one:

```json
{
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "kind": "review|sql|trust-boundary|side-effect|...",
  "file": "path/to/file.ts",
  "line": 42,
  "message": "Short description",
  "addressedBy": "remediation-commit|deferred-to-human|follow-up-ticket|none"
}
```

### Inbox check (CTL-749)

After `/review` Task returns, check for mid-flight context updates from the human:

1. If `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl` exists and is non-empty, read it fully.
2. Parse each JSONL line — entries have `kind: "comment"` or `kind: "description_changed"`.
3. For each entry, decide:
   - **Absorb and continue**: the update is additive context (clarification, extra constraints,
     "also handle X") — fold it into your working context and continue. Post a brief reply comment
     acknowledging the update (one sentence).
   - **Pause and replan**: the update fundamentally changes scope or invalidates the current
     approach — emit `failed` with `reason: "mid_flight_replan_needed"` via
     `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/phase-agent-emit-complete` and post the reason to Linear as a
     comment before exiting.
4. After reading, archive processed entries:
   ```bash
   [[ -f "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl" ]] && \
     mv "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl" \
        "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.processed-$(date +%s).jsonl" || true
   ```
5. If no inbox file or it is empty, continue normally.

## End block

```bash
TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
TMP="${SIGNAL_FILE}.tmp.$$"
jq --arg ts "$TS" --arg artifact "$ARTIFACT" \
  '.updatedAt = $ts | .artifact = $artifact' \
  "$SIGNAL_FILE" > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" "$SIGNAL_FILE"
```

Mirror the phase output to Linear as a single comment (CTL-632). Renders
the PASS/FAIL result label, findings-by-severity, remediation commit SHA,
and the full findings JSON inside a `<details>` block. Body is
hard-truncated to 30,000 bytes. Fail-open and idempotent via the
per-phase marker file.

## Step N — Capture friction (compound loop, CTL-789)

Before you emit completion, append this phase's friction to the shared per-ticket
friction log. This is the PRODUCER half of the compound-engineering loop: the
`ticket-compound` curator harvests `thoughts/shared/friction/${TICKET}.md` to distil
durable learnings and ADR proposals. REPLACE each `<…>` placeholder below with your
real experience THIS phase — terse, 3–6 lines total; `"None."` is a valid value when
the phase was frictionless. `${TICKET}` is already resolved in the Prelude — do not
re-derive it. This append is **off the critical path and best-effort**: it must NEVER
fail or block `emit-complete`.

```bash
# --- Compound-engineering friction capture (CTL-789, Slice 1). Off critical path; NEVER block emit. ---
FRICTION_LOG="thoughts/shared/friction/${TICKET}.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FRICTION_LOG")"
[ -f "$FRICTION_LOG" ] || printf '# Friction log — %s\n' "${TICKET}" > "$FRICTION_LOG"
cat >> "$FRICTION_LOG" <<EOF

## review · ${TICKET} · $(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z)
- **Backtracks / redone work:** <where you backtracked or redid work this phase — or "None.">
- **Missing / wrong / hard-to-find context:** <context that was absent, stale, or hard to locate — or "None.">
- **If I'd known:** <the ADR / guidance / past learning that would have saved this — the compounding signal — or "None.">
