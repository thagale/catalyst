# Contract tests for lib/phase-artifact-gate.sh (CTL-1081).
#
# Covers:
#  1. match_thoughts_artifact: tail form, slug form (lowercase), slug form (uppercase),
#     cross-ticket lookalike rejection, wrong-ticket rejection, no-match return.
#  2. Spec map: prior_artifact_for_phase, own_thoughts_artifact_dir_for_phase.
#  3. Contract / divergence: dispatch + emit-complete both source the lib;
#     phase-research + phase-plan SKILLs reference match_thoughts_artifact.

# Run: bash plugins/dev/scripts/__tests__/phase-artifact-gate.test.sh
