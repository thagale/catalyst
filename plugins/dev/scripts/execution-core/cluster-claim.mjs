// (HRW ownership + Linear-CAS claim wiring) consumes it next. Keeping it pure
// and self-contained makes it PR-order-independent: the only externalities are
// the GraphQL `post` seam (injectable) and the Linear API token in the env.
//
// CTL-1616 PR3: resolveSecret from the shared zero-import lib/ leaf is NOT a
// cross-module import of an execution-core sibling (the PR-order-independence
// rule above is about staying independent of linear-query.mjs/
// cluster-heartbeat.mjs's release order, not about the shared secret-contract
// leaf; cluster-sync.mjs and doctor.mjs already set this precedent). Folds
// defaultPost's own LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY ladder below.

// ─── The storage mechanism (VERIFIED via live Linear API probe, 2026-06-08) ──
// Linear has no custom fields and labels can't model a counter, so the claim +
// fence + owner-name record is ONE Linear attachment per ticket:
//
//   attachmentCreate(input:{
//     issueId, title:"catalyst-meta", url:"catalyst://fence/<TICKET>",
//     metadata:{ owner_host, catalyst_generation, phase, claimed_at }
//   })
//
//   • attachmentCreate with the SAME url is an UPSERT — it returns the same
//     attachment id with new metadata. (attachmentUpdate requires `title` and
//     does NOT accept `metadata`, so create is the only upsert path.)
//   • The write produces ZERO issue.history entries → invisible to the human
//     activity feed (no notification spam).
//   • READ via issue.attachments and pick the node whose url starts with
//     `catalyst://fence/`.
//
// Linear has no native compare-and-swap, so claimTicket is a SOFT-CAS: write the
// claim, then read it back and confirm the owner+generation we just wrote are
// what's on the ticket. A concurrent host that wrote last wins the read-back; we
// lose and back off. Single-writer discipline (the owning host) + the read-back
// staleness signal is what makes a small trusted fleet safe without consensus.
