  Phase-agent that watches the open PR through to merge (CTL-449 Initiative 1
  Phase 3). Lifts the active listen loop from the legacy `oneshot` Phase 5
  body: event-driven wait on `catalyst-events wait-for`, inline resolution of
  CI fix-ups, bot review threads, and BEHIND rebases, then `gh pr merge
  --squash --delete-branch` when the PR reaches CLEAN. Linear Done transition
  and worktree teardown are owned by phase-teardown (CTL-703). Dispatched as
  a `claude --bg` job by `phase-agent-dispatch`, which invokes it via slash
  command — hence `user-invocable: true`.

# phase-monitor-merge

The reactive half of the worker lifecycle. The PR exists (opened by [[phase-pr]]); this phase agent
drives it to MERGED. Linear Done transition and worktree teardown are owned by [[phase-teardown]]
(CTL-703). Implementation lifts the loop from `plugins/dev/skills/oneshot/SKILL.md` §"Step 2: Active
PR Listen Loop" — same event names, same `mergeable_state` state machine, same inline fix-up cap —
wrapped in the phase-agent envelope (signal file, comms channel, terminal event emission).

## Prerequisites

- `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR`, `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID`, `CATALYST_PHASE=monitor-merge`,
  `CATALYST_TICKET` set by [[phase-agent-dispatch]].
- The prior phase's signal file `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/<TICKET>/phase-pr.json` exists with
  `status=done` AND `.pr.number` populated by [[phase-pr]].
- `gh` CLI authenticated; broker daemon optionally running (the loop falls back to direct
  `catalyst-events wait-for` filtering when it is not — see [[wait-for-github]]).

## /goal condition

Plan §"Per-phase /goal conditions":

```
/goal "`gh pr view --json merged` returns `true` for the PR linked to
       ${TICKET} (PR #${PR_NUMBER}) AND I have posted the merge mirror
       comment to Linear and emitted phase-monitor-merge.complete (I have
       printed both confirmations to my transcript);
       OR 24 wall-clock hours have elapsed without merge completion
       and I have recorded status:timeout."
```

Wall-clock cap is 24h (per plan §Failure handling).

## Phase-specific work — active listen loop

Reuse the reactive listen loop from [[oneshot]] § Phase 5 Step 2. The full control flow lives there;
this skill copies the body verbatim, substituting `phase-monitor-merge` framing in place of
`oneshot`'s session-id machinery. Key elements that MUST be preserved:

1. **Event-driven, not polling.** `catalyst-events wait-for` blocks until a PR-lifecycle event
   fires. Filter clause matches the canonical event names `github.pr.merged`,
   `github.check_suite.completed`, `github.pr_review*`, and `github.push` keyed by
   `attributes."vcs.pr.number"` (PR/review events) or `body.payload.prNumbers`
   (check_suite/workflow_run — see [[event-schema]]). When the broker daemon is up, register a
   `pr_lifecycle` interest via `agent.checkin.claimed_pr` and wait on
   `filter.wake.${CATALYST_SESSION_ID}` instead (the single-wake path — see [[monitor-events]]
   Pattern 3). **CTL-1680:** when the reviewer-arrival window (Merge step) sets
   `MERGE_WAKE_TIMEOUT_SEC`, the next wait MUST cap its `--timeout` at that many seconds so the loop
   re-evaluates the window deadline even if no PR-lifecycle event arrives — otherwise the general
   wait can block far past the window (600s broker / 180+7200s raw) and delay an already-earned merge.

2. **REST is authoritative.** Every loop iteration calls `gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}`
   and reads `.merged` + `.mergeable_state`. Never use `gh pr view --json mergeable` (GraphQL is
   eventually consistent for the merge-state fields and frequently lies).

3. **State machine.** Branch on `mergeable_state`:

   | state            | action                                                                                                                                  |
   | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | clean            | proceed to merge step                                                                                                                   |
   | blocked          | resolve via `/catalyst-dev:review-comments` (bot threads) or run an inline CI fix-up commit (up to 3 attempts); 4th attempt → `stalled` |
   | behind           | `git fetch && git rebase origin/<base> && git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null push --force-with-lease`                                      |
   | dirty            | merge conflicts — emit `failed` with reason "merge conflicts (DIRTY)"                                                                   |
   | unknown/unstable | continue waiting for the next event                                                                                                     |

4. **Human reviewer changes-requested.** After every wake, query `gh pr view --json reviews` for the
   most recent `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from a human reviewer (filter on `.author.login` not matching
   known bots). If present, emit `failed` with reason "human reviewer ${LOGIN} requested changes —
   operator action required". Do NOT attempt to address human review comments programmatically.
   The same applies to an unresolved human review **thread** left on a `COMMENTED`/`APPROVED`
   review: it never surfaces as `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and does not always flip
   `mergeable_state`, so the unresolved-thread gate counts human threads separately and
   emits `failed` for them instead of dispatching `/catalyst-dev:review-comments` (CTL-1680).

5. **Wake narration.** Every iteration produces one short line of assistant text before re-entering
   the wait (defeats the assistant `end_turn` rendering bleed described in [[monitor-events]] §
   Narration). Shape: `wake: <event.name> #<PR_NUMBER> — <action being taken>`.

## Merge

Once `mergeable_state == "clean"` (and the PR isn't already merged):

```bash
# CTL-864: cross-host fence — bow out if a takeover superseded us. No-op single-host.
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/cluster-fence-guard.sh" --phase "$PHASE" --ticket "$TICKET" || exit 10
# CTL-1051: never merge a stale ref. Compare the PR head to the worktree HEAD;
# on mismatch, re-push with lease and re-verify before merging.

  source "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/draft-pr.sh"

# CTL-1680: reviewer-arrival window. mergeable_state == "clean" reflects only

# CLEAN PR, give an in-flight reviewer a bounded window to land its verdict.
PHASE_REVIEWER_ARRIVAL_WAIT_SEC="${PHASE_REVIEWER_ARRIVAL_WAIT_SEC:-300}"
# CTL-1680 (Codex #3079 P2): resolve REVIEWED_HEAD FRESH from REST, never from the
# CTL-1051 PR_HEAD_OID above — that variable holds the PRE-push remote SHA (the
# stale-ref reconcile redirected draft_pr_push_verify's verified SHA to /dev/null),
# so reusing it would age/scope the OLD commit after a reconcile re-push. REST
# `.head.sha` is authoritative and reflects the just-pushed head.

GH_OWNER="${REPO%/*}"; GH_NAME="${REPO#*/}"
# CTL-1680 (Codex #3079 re-review P1): anchor the window to when this head became
# REVIEWABLE ON THE PR (its push time), NOT when the commit was authored. A commit
# created during a long verify phase can predate PR exposure by hours; anchoring to
# the author/committer date would make HEAD_AGE_SEC already exceed the window and
# merge with zero reviewer window. GraphQL `pushedDate` is the push time; fall back
# to `committedDate`, then to the REST committer date.
# CTL-1680 (Codex #3079 round-2 P1): a PR opened DRAFT by phase-implement and only
# promoted to ready-for-review by phase-pr later (`gh pr ready`, no new commits) is
# not actually reviewable until that promotion — the automated reviewer does not see
# a draft. Anchoring solely to the commit's pushedDate would let HEAD_AGE_SEC already
# exceed the window at promotion time, merging with zero window. Take the LATER of
# pushedDate and the most recent READY_FOR_REVIEW_EVENT timelineItem (a PR never
# drafted has no such event, so pushedDate wins unchanged).
# CTL-1680 (Codex #3079 round-3 P1): a TRANSIENT failure of this lookup must not be
# treated as "no ready-for-review event". The old form swallowed every error with
# `|| true`, so a network/API blip produced an empty result, fell through to the REST
# committer date (which for a long-drafted PR is far older than its promotion), made
# HEAD_AGE_SEC already exceed the window, and merged with ZERO reviewer wait — the
# exact hole the window exists to close. Retry, then distinguish the two outcomes:
#   * query SUCCEEDED but returned nothing  → genuinely no timestamp; the REST
#     committer-date fallback below is correct.
#   * query FAILED every attempt            → exposure time is UNKNOWN; fail SAFE by
#     treating HEAD as freshly exposed (age 0) so the FULL window is waited out.

# CTL-1680 (Codex #3079 P2): PAGINATED — mirrors pr-block-probe.mjs's REVIEW_THREADS_QUERY

# tracks that distinctly from a genuine zero count.

# The author filter below used to drop every human thread, so a human who left an
# unresolved COMMENTED/APPROVED thread (neither of which flips mergeable_state, and
# neither of which the CHANGES_REQUESTED check catches) left this gate reading zero and
# the skill merged past an open conversation. GitHub's ruleset also enforces thread
# resolution on this repo, so this is defence-in-depth rather than an open merge hole —
# but the skill's own gate must not be the weaker of the two. Routing differs by author
# and mirrors the existing policy: bot threads are auto-remediated via
# /catalyst-dev:review-comments; human threads are NEVER addressed programmatically
# (same rule as human CHANGES_REQUESTED) and terminate the phase for the operator.

Deployment verification (`skipDeployVerification=false`) is **not** in this phase's scope — that is
`phase-monitor-deploy` (plan §Initiative 1 Phase 5). This skill exits cleanly the moment the merge
lands and the End-block mirror is posted (CTL-703: Linear Done and worktree teardown happen in
phase-teardown; the compound-log entry below is best-effort and never extends the phase on failure).

## Compound-log closing entry (CTL-813 — off the critical path)

After the merge lands, write the ticket's compound-log entry so the estimation loop's sink fills
autonomously (the unbuilt CTL-189 — in `merge-pr` a human answers these prompts; here YOU author
them). **Best-effort: on ANY failure log one line and continue to the End block — never fail or
block the phase on this.**

1. **Re-score from the merged diff** (CTL-746 structural bands → points XS=1 S=3 M=5 L=8 XL=13; LOC
   = additions+deletions: `<50→1, <200→3, <800→5, <2000→8, else 13`):

```bash
LOC=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}" --jq '.additions + .deletions' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if   [[ -z "$LOC" ]];      then POINTS=""
elif [[ "$LOC" -lt 50 ]];  then POINTS=1
elif [[ "$LOC" -lt 200 ]]; then POINTS=3
elif [[ "$LOC" -lt 800 ]]; then POINTS=5
elif [[ "$LOC" -lt 2000 ]]; then POINTS=8
else POINTS=13; fi
```

Adjust ±1 step with judgment (e.g. heavy rework you personally resolved — CI fix-up loops, rebases —
justifies a bump). Skip the whole section when `POINTS` is empty.

2. **Author the two reflections yourself** — you just walked this PR through merge, so you have the
   ground truth: `what_worked` (1-2 sentences) and `what_surprised_me` (1-2 sentences; the
   BEHIND-rebase treadmill, bot review threads, or flaky CI you resolved are exactly this signal).

3. **Write the entry.** The helper resolves `estimate_at_start`/cost/wall from its defaults; on a
   missing default, retry once with explicit overrides; on a duplicate (re-walked phase), the
   "already exists" failure IS the skip path:

```bash
CL="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compound-log.sh"
"$CL" write "$TICKET" --pr "$PR_NUMBER" --estimate-actual "$POINTS" \
  --what-worked "$WHAT_WORKED" --what-surprised-me "$WHAT_SURPRISED" 2>/dev/null \
|| "$CL" write "$TICKET" --pr "$PR_NUMBER" --estimate-actual "$POINTS" \
  --what-worked "$WHAT_WORKED" --what-surprised-me "$WHAT_SURPRISED" \
  --cost-usd 0 --estimate-start 0 \
|| echo "phase-monitor-merge: compound-log entry skipped (non-fatal)" >&2
```

Do NOT run the corpus refresh here (that is `compound-estimate` step 6 / operator cadence — a
background phase worker must not mutate the committed corpus).

4. **Run the cross-ticket retro (CTL-831 — the per-ticket learning step).** After the compound-log
   entry (success OR skip), invoke `/catalyst-dev:ticket-retro` with no arguments. It regenerates
   `thoughts/shared/retros/ticket/<today>.md` over the since-last-retro window (same-day re-runs are
   cumulative by design) and refreshes the watch-items the morning briefing surfaces — this is how
   the system learns from every ticket it ships. Same contract as the entry above: **best-effort,
   never blocks the End block** — on any retro failure, log one line and continue.

## End block

Mirror the merge outcome to Linear as a single comment (CTL-632). Best-effort end-of-loop summary
(per the design decision — per-finding detail like individual CI fix-up commits or bot review
threads stays on the PR itself): merge commit + base branch, the final CI check rollup
(passed/total), and a count of bot reviews handled (e.g. Codex) whose threads were resolved before
the merge. Merge metadata is re-read from the signal file (`.pr.mergeCommitSha` / `.pr.mergedAt`,
written in the merge step above); CI + reviews are pulled once from `gh pr view`. Runs inside the
ticket worktree (CTL-703: no auto-teardown `cd` here; the skill stays in the ticket worktree and
relies on absolute signal paths and the PR number). Body hard-truncated to 30,000 bytes. Fail-open
and idempotent via the per-phase marker file. Uniquely-named fence so the e2e test can extract just
this block.

Failure modes that emit `phase.monitor-merge.failed.${TICKET}`:

- `dirty` (merge conflicts) — operator must rebase manually.
- Human reviewer `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — operator must address comments.
- Unresolved **human** review thread(s) — an unresolved `COMMENTED`/`APPROVED` conversation
  blocks the merge but is not `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, so it terminates here for the operator
  rather than being auto-remediated (CTL-1680).
- CI blocked after 3 auto-fix attempts.
- `gh pr merge` succeeded but REST confirms `.merged == false` (rare; usually a branch-protection
  rule mismatch).
- 24-hour wall-clock cap — orchestrator dispatches a fix-up or escalates.

## Comms discipline

Inherits the contract from [[_phase-agent-template]]:

| Type        | When                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`      | At start with PR number; after each successful inline fix-up.          |
| `attention` | DIRTY, human changes-requested, CI blocked after 3 attempts.           |
| `question`  | Reserved — this phase rarely needs to ask, since the work is reactive. |
| `done`      | Emitted by `phase-agent-emit-complete` on merge confirmed.             |

## Why this is a thin wrapper

Plan architectural commitment #3. The listen loop logic lives in [[oneshot]] SKILL.md and is
exercised every day. Lifting it into a phase-agent skill without duplicating the body keeps both
paths in lockstep — when the legacy oneshot path retires (plan §Initiative 1 Phase 6), this skill
becomes the sole owner.
