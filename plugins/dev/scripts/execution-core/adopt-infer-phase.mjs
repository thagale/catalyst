// adopt-infer-phase.mjs — CLI shim giving bash a one-line call to inferResumePhase.
//
// Usage:
//   node adopt-infer-phase.mjs --ticket PROJ-XXXX [--cwd <worktree-path>]
//
// Prints exactly one bare phase token on stdout and exits 0, or prints an error
// message on stderr and exits non-zero. Designed for bash $(…) capture.
//
// This is the enabling dependency for catalyst-adopt.sh Phase 4 dispatch.
//
// Import strategy: recovery.mjs imports bun:sqlite and is not loadable under bare
// node. This shim inlines the same reverse-walk logic using only work-done-probes.mjs
// (node-only imports) and workflow-descriptor.mjs (pure readFileSync). It mirrors the
// canonical `inferResumePhase` in recovery.mjs — INCLUDING its call convention, which
// passes ONLY `{ cwd }` (recovery.mjs:4514: `inferResumePhase(ticket, { cwd })`).
//
// Deliberate scope — worktree-detectable phases only. The canonical caller does NOT
// thread orchDir, so the orchDir-gated probes (triage/verify/review/pr/monitor-merge/
// monitor-deploy) never fire there; the scheduler owns everything ABOVE implement —
// verify-verdict routing (verify→remediate, scheduler.mjs:1940-1947) and stale
// post-PR signal sanitization (sanitizeStalePostPrSignals, scheduler.mjs:1531-1587) —
// AROUND inferResumePhase, not inside it. Mirroring that, this shim caps inference at
// the range it can prove from the worktree alone (research/plan/implement/commit) and
// re-dispatches from there; the dispatched phase then re-enters the normal scheduler
// path for the precise post-implement routing. Resuming EARLIER than the true phase is
// conservative and safe — the re-run phases (verify/review) are read-only/idempotent, so
// nothing is skipped. Threading orchDir here (a prior attempt) DIVERGED from the
// canonical impl and made the shim select `review`/`teardown` off raw signals without
// the scheduler's verdict/staleness guards — CTL-1642 Codex #3175 P1s (#1, #2).
//
// Calling-convention note: the worktree-scoped probes (research/plan/implement/commit)
// key on `repoRoot`, so makeAdaptedProbes passes repoRoot=cwd (cwd IS the worktree).

// makeAdaptedProbes — wrap WORK_DONE_PROBES so the worktree-scoped probes get the

// the orchDir-gated post-implement probes short-circuit false — the shim caps at the
// worktree-detectable range exactly as recovery.mjs's `inferResumePhase(ticket,{cwd})`.
//
// worktreePath=cwd is the load-bearing part (CTL-1642 Codex #3175 P1). Passing only
// repoRoot made every worktree-scoped probe re-derive the worktree by branch name via
// resolveWorktree, whose porcelain match is EXACTLY `refs/heads/<ticket>`. catalyst-adopt.sh
// accepts four branch shapes (`<ticket>`, `<ticket>-*`, `*/<ticket>`, `*/<ticket>-*`), so
// an adopted worktree on any shape but the bare ticket — including the `ryan/<ticket>-slug`
// form Linear's branchName produces — resolved to null. Every probe then returned false,
// inference fell back to `research`, and when a retained research signal was already `done`
// the dispatcher exited 0 idempotently: adoption reported success while launching no worker.
// cwd IS the worktree here, so handing it over directly is both correct and strictly more
// robust than re-deriving it — no branch shape, casing, or detached HEAD can defeat it.
