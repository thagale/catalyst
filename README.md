# Catalyst - Claude Code Workspace

A portable development workflow for Claude Code, packaged as a Claude Code plugin marketplace.

This is the workspace I use daily for AI-assisted development. It's battle-tested on real projects
and optimized for efficient, context-aware AI collaboration. I'm sharing it so others can use it,
fork it, and contribute ideas back.

## Tech Stack & Integrations

Catalyst integrates with your development tools through both **CLI-based** (token-efficient) and
**MCP-based** (richer features) approaches:

### Project Management & Issue Tracking

- **Linear** - Issue tracking, sprint planning, ticket lifecycle (CLI via
  [Linearis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linearis))
  - `catalyst-dev`: Core research agents and workflow commands
  - `catalyst-pm`: Advanced PM workflows (PRDs, strategy, priorities)
  - `catalyst-pm-ops`: Operational PM workflows (cycle analysis, milestone tracking, backlog grooming, cadence, comms)

### Version Control & Code Hosting

- **GitHub** - Pull requests, code review, repository management (CLI via `gh`)
  - `catalyst-dev`: PR creation, branch management, worktree workflows

### Error Monitoring & Debugging

- **Sentry** - Production error monitoring, stack traces, root cause analysis (MCP + CLI)
  - `catalyst-debugging`: Sentry MCP integration (~20k tokens when enabled)
  - Supports single-project and multi-project configurations

### Product Analytics

- **PostHog** - User behavior, conversion funnels, feature analytics (MCP)
  - `catalyst-analytics`: PostHog MCP integration (~40k tokens when enabled)

### Documentation & Code Search

- **Context7** - Library documentation lookup (MCP, ~2k tokens)
  - `catalyst-dev`: Built-in, always available
- **Exa** - Web research and external documentation (API)
  - `catalyst-dev`: External research agent

### Thoughts & Memory System

- **HumanLayer** - Persistent memory, shared context, team collaboration (CLI via `humanlayer`)
  - All plugins: Foundation for research, plans, handoffs, and reports

### Token Efficiency Strategy

**Why CLI + lightweight MCP?** Most development sessions don't need heavy integrations:

- Start with `catalyst-dev` (~3.5k tokens): Core workflow + Linear + GitHub
- Enable `catalyst-analytics` when analyzing user behavior (~+40k tokens)
- Enable `catalyst-debugging` when investigating production errors (~+20k tokens)
- Disable when done to free context for code and conversation

This keeps your typical session lean while having powerful tools available when needed.

## What's Inside

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

Get started in 5 minutes with the unified setup script:

```bash
# Download the setup script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst/main/setup-catalyst.sh
chmod +x setup-catalyst.sh

# Run it (requires interactive input)
./setup-catalyst.sh
```

This script will guide you through:

- ✅ Prerequisites check and installation (HumanLayer CLI, jq, etc.)
- ✅ Thoughts repository setup (one per org, backed up to GitHub)
- ✅ Project configuration (ticket prefix, project name)
- ✅ Integration setup (Linear, Sentry, PostHog, Exa)
- ✅ Worktree directory creation
- ✅ HumanLayer thoughts initialization and syncing

**Then install the plugins:**

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst
/plugin install catalyst-dev

# Restart Claude Code
```

**Start the stack:**

```bash
catalyst-stack start
```

This brings up broker → monitor → execution-core in dependency order. Run it once after each reboot.

You're ready! Try `/research-codebase` in your next session.

See the [documentation site](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai) for detailed setup instructions.

## Installation

Alternatively, install plugins manually via Claude Code plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace repository
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst

# Install core workflow (required)
/plugin install catalyst-dev

# Optional: Install PM plugin (strategy, PRDs, prioritization)
/plugin install catalyst-pm

# Optional: Install PM ops plugin (cycle/backlog/cadence operations)
/plugin install catalyst-pm-ops

# Optional: Install meeting hygiene plugin (agendas, notes, cleanup)
/plugin install catalyst-meeting-hygiene

# Optional: Install discovery plugin (user research, metrics, prototyping)
/plugin install catalyst-discovery

# Optional: Install analytics plugin (if you use PostHog)
/plugin install catalyst-analytics

# Optional: Install debugging plugin (if you use Sentry)
/plugin install catalyst-debugging

# Optional: Install meta plugin (workflow discovery)
/plugin install catalyst-meta
```

### Session-Based MCP Management

Plugins automatically load/unload MCPs when enabled/disabled:

```bash
# Enable PM tools for sprint planning and cycle reviews
/plugin enable catalyst-pm  # Lightweight CLI-based, minimal context

# Enable analytics when analyzing user behavior
/plugin enable catalyst-analytics  # Loads PostHog MCP (+40k context)

# Disable when done to free context
/plugin disable catalyst-analytics  # Unloads PostHog MCP (-40k context)

# Enable debugging for incident response
/plugin enable catalyst-debugging  # Loads Sentry MCP (+20k context)

# Can enable multiple plugins simultaneously
/plugin enable catalyst-pm catalyst-analytics catalyst-debugging
```

**Why this matters**: Most development sessions don't need analytics or debugging MCPs. Starting
with just `catalyst-dev` keeps your context at ~3.5k tokens instead of ~65k, leaving more room for
code and conversation.

### Updating Plugins

Keep your Catalyst plugins up to date with bug fixes and new features:

```bash
# Update the marketplace to fetch latest from GitHub
claude plugin marketplace update catalyst

# Restart Claude Code to load updated plugins
# (Exit and reopen, or start a new session)
```

**When to update:**

- 🐛 **Bug fixes**: Patch versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 3.0.1) - Fix issues like incorrect CLI syntax
- ✨ **New features**: Minor versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 3.1.0) - New commands or capabilities
- 🔄 **Breaking changes**: Major versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 4.0.0) - May require configuration updates

**Important:** A restart is required for plugin updates to take effect. Active sessions use the old
version until you restart Claude Code.

**One-command post-merge update** (ff-pull + rsync into the live cache + restart):

```bash
catalyst-stack restart --hotpatch
```

**Check your versions:**

```bash
# List installed plugins and their versions
/plugin list
```

## Complete Workflow

```
/research-codebase → /create-plan → /implement-plan → /validate-plan → /create-pr → /merge-pr
```

With handoffs for context persistence:

```
/create-handoff → /resume-handoff
```

Agents proactively monitor context during implementation and will prompt you to create handoffs
before running out of context, creating structured handoff documents that add to persistent memory.

### Agent Teams

For complex implementations spanning multiple domains, Catalyst supports
[Claude Code agent teams](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6) — multiple Claude
instances working in parallel on a shared codebase:

```
/implement-plan --team thoughts/shared/plans/my-plan.md
/oneshot --team PROJ-123
```

A lead agent (Opus) coordinates the work, spawning teammates (Sonnet) that each own distinct files.
Each teammate can spawn its own research sub-agents, enabling two-level parallelism. See
[How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system)
for the patterns behind this approach.

## Core Philosophy

### Token Efficiency Through Structured Context

1. **Parallel Agent Research** - Multiple specialized agents research concurrently
2. **Context Compression** - Research compressed into structured summaries
3. **Focused Planning** - Planning agents work with compressed context
4. **Persistent Memory** - Handoffs and thoughts system preserve context across sessions

### Reusability and Shared Memory

Uses the [HumanLayer thoughts system](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer) for shared
persistent memory across teams and projects. The research → plan → implement → validate workflow is
adapted from HumanLayer's approach.

### CLI-First Integration

When possible, uses CLIs instead of MCPs for token efficiency:

- Linear: Linearis CLI (1k tokens) vs Linear MCP (13k tokens) = **13x reduction**
- Infrastructure research via CLIs (Sentry, GitHub)

## Key Features

**Large Long-Term Memory and Context**

- Thoughts system for persistent memory across projects
- Structured handoff documents for context preservation
- Research artifacts saved and referenceable
- Plan documents that persist implementation context

**Token Efficiency**

- Parallel agents compress research before synthesis
- CLI-based tools minimize token overhead
- Focused agents for specific tasks
- Context-aware handoff prompts

**Secure Configuration**

- Template system prevents committing secrets
- `.gitignore` protection for sensitive files
- No hardcoded credentials

## Requirements

**Core Tools**:

- Claude Code
- Git
- jq

**CLI Integrations** (optional but recommended):

- `linearis` - Linear integration (`npm install -g linearis`)
- `gh` - GitHub CLI
- `sentry-cli` - Error monitoring
- `humanlayer` - Thoughts system ([install](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer))

**MCP Tools** (bundled with plugins):

- Context7 - Built into `catalyst-dev` (~3.5k tokens)
- PostHog - Built into `catalyst-analytics` (~40k tokens when enabled)
- Sentry - Built into `catalyst-debugging` (~20k tokens when enabled)

Run the prerequisite check:

```bash
/check_prerequisites
```

## Recurring Workflows with /loop

The built-in `/loop` command runs a skill or prompt on a recurring interval. Use it for monitoring
and periodic tasks during active development sessions.

### CI Check Monitoring (after pushing a PR)

```
/loop 2m gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>
```

Polls every 2 minutes until checks pass or fail.

### Post-Merge Deployment Monitoring

```
/loop 3m gh run list --branch main --limit 3 --json workflowName,status,conclusion
```

Monitors GitHub Actions workflow runs triggered by your merge.

### Daily Context Engineering Dashboard

```
/loop 1d /context-daily
```

Refreshes the context engineering adoption dashboard once per day. Alternative to the GitHub Actions
cron — useful in long-running sessions.

### Cycle Health Monitoring

```
/loop 4h /analyze-cycle
```

Generates a fresh cycle health report every 4 hours during a sprint.

### PR/Linear Sync

```
/loop 2h /sync-prs
```

Checks for orphaned PRs and out-of-sync Linear issues every 2 hours.

**Note**: `/loop` is session-scoped (max ~3 days). For persistent scheduling, use GitHub Actions
cron. `/loop` is best for active monitoring during development sessions.

mark, wordmark, lockups, favicon set, and the 1200×630 social preview card. All SVGs use
`stroke="currentColor"` so they theme via CSS; the OG card raster (`assets/brand-v2/og-card.png`)
bakes in the Operator Console palette.

Repo admins: to set the GitHub repository social preview, go to **Settings → Social preview → Upload
an image** and upload `assets/brand-v2/og-card.png`.
