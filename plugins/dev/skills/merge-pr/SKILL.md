# Merge Pull Request

Safely merges a PR after comprehensive verification, with Linear integration and automated cleanup.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Project setup + orch-monitor daemon liveness (REQUIRED — Phase 6 consumes webhook events)
if [[ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-project-setup.sh" ]]; then
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-project-setup.sh" || exit 1
fi
```

## Branch Protection — Safety Rules

Read and follow the safety rules in
`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/merge-blocker-diagnosis.md"` — specifically the "Safety Rules"
section. Summary: **NEVER** use `--admin`, `--force`, or any flag that bypasses branch protection.
Always resolve blockers legitimately or escalate with specifics.

## Configuration

Read team configuration from `.catalyst/config.json`:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=".catalyst/config.json"
[[ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]] && CONFIG_FILE=".claude/config.json"
TEAM_KEY=$(jq -r '.catalyst.linear.teamKey // "PROJ"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
TEST_CMD=$(jq -r '.catalyst.pr.testCommand // "make test"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
```

## Process:

### 1. Identify PR to merge

**If argument provided:**

- Use that PR number: `/merge_pr 123`

**If no argument:**

```bash
# Try current branch
gh pr view --json number,url,title,state,mergeable 2>/dev/null
```

If no PR on current branch:

```bash
gh pr list --limit 10 --json number,title,headRefName,state
```

Ask: "Which PR would you like to merge? (enter number)"

### 2. Get PR details

```bash
gh pr view $pr_number --json \
  number,url,title,state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,\
  baseRefName,headRefName,reviewDecision
```

**Extract:**

- PR number, URL, title
- Mergeable status
- Base branch (usually main)
- Head branch (feature branch)
- Review decision (APPROVED, REVIEW_REQUIRED, etc.)

### 3. Verify PR is open and mergeable

```bash
state=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json state -q .state)
mergeable=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json mergeable -q .mergeable)
```

**If PR not OPEN:**

```
❌ PR #$pr_number is $state

Only open PRs can be merged.
```

**If not mergeable (CONFLICTING):**

```
❌ PR has merge conflicts

Resolve conflicts first:
  gh pr checkout $pr_number
  git fetch origin $base_branch
  git merge origin/$base_branch
  # ... resolve conflicts ...
  git push
```

Exit with error.

### 4. Check if head branch is up-to-date with base

```bash
# Checkout PR branch
gh pr checkout $pr_number

# Fetch latest base
base_branch=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
git fetch origin $base_branch

# Check if behind
if git log HEAD..origin/$base_branch --oneline | grep -q .; then
    echo "Branch is behind $base_branch"
fi
```

**If behind:**

```bash
# Auto-rebase
git rebase origin/$base_branch

# Check for conflicts
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Rebase conflicts"
    git rebase --abort
    exit 1
fi

# Push rebased branch
git push --force-with-lease
```

**If conflicts during rebase:**

```
❌ Rebase conflicts detected

Conflicting files:
  $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)

Resolve manually:
  1. Fix conflicts in listed files
  2. git add <resolved-files>
  3. git rebase --continue
  4. git push --force-with-lease
  5. Run /catalyst-dev:merge-pr again
```

Exit with error.

### 5. Run local tests

**Read test command from config:**

```bash
test_cmd=$(jq -r '.catalyst.pr.testCommand // "make test"' .catalyst/config.json)
```

**Execute tests:**

```bash
echo "Running tests: $test_cmd"
if ! $test_cmd; then
    echo "❌ Tests failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

**If tests fail:**

```
❌ Local tests failed

Fix failing tests before merge:
  $test_cmd

Or skip tests (not recommended):
  /catalyst-dev:merge-pr $pr_number --skip-tests
```

Exit with error (unless `--skip-tests` flag provided).

### 6. Diagnose and resolve merge blockers — reactive PR lifecycle

Read and follow the full workflow in
`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/merge-blocker-diagnosis.md"`. The wake-up
mechanism here is the **canonical "Reactive PR lifecycle" pattern from
`monitor-events` (Pattern 3, CTL-228)** — a single `wait-for` that fires on
any of: PR merged, PR closed, CI failure, review changes-requested, or push
to the base branch. Each wake-up is paired with an authoritative `gh api`
REST re-check; the event tells the agent *what changed*, `gh api` tells it
*the current truth*.

Why a multi-event filter and not just `github.pr.merged`: most of the time
between PR-create and PR-merge is spent on CI, review, and base-branch
churn — not waiting on a clean merge to land. Subscribing only to the merge
event means the agent learns nothing from a check failure or a
changes-requested review until the 600-second timeout fires, at which point
it falls back to REST polling via `gh api`. The disjunctive filter restores
event-driven dispatch for those cases.

```bash
# Two-phase compliant cadence loop — see [[wait-for-github]]. The 600s timeout
# serves as a fallback cadence; the authoritative REST check runs on every wake-up.
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${pr_number}" --jq '.base.ref')
ITER=0
MAX_ITER=20

while [ $ITER -lt $MAX_ITER ]; do
  ITER=$((ITER + 1))

  # Reactive multi-event subscription. wait-for is a no-op on event arrival;
  # on timeout we fall through to the authoritative re-check below. The
  # 600-second timeout is the fallback cadence when no events arrive (e.g.
  # daemon down).
  EVENT_JSON=$(catalyst-events wait-for \
    --filter '
      (.attributes."event.name" == "github.pr.merged" and .attributes."vcs.pr.number" == '"$pr_number"') or
      (.attributes."event.name" == "github.pr.closed" and .attributes."vcs.pr.number" == '"$pr_number"') or
      (.attributes."event.name" == "github.check_suite.completed"
         and (.body.payload.prNumbers // [] | index('"$pr_number"') != null)
         and (.attributes."cicd.pipeline.run.conclusion" == "failure" or .attributes."cicd.pipeline.run.conclusion" == "timed_out")) or
      (.attributes."event.name" == "github.pr_review.submitted"
         and .attributes."vcs.pr.number" == '"$pr_number"'
         and (.body.payload.state == "changes_requested"
              or (.body.payload.state == "commented" and (.body.payload.author.type // "") == "Bot"))) or
      (.attributes."event.name" == "github.push" and .attributes."vcs.ref.name" == "refs/heads/'"$BASE_BRANCH"'")
    ' \
    --timeout 600 || true)

  # MANDATORY authoritative REST re-check on every wake-up.
  STATE=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${pr_number}" \
    --jq 'if .merged then "MERGED" elif .state == "closed" then "CLOSED" else "OPEN" end' \
    2>/dev/null || echo "OPEN")
  if [ "$STATE" = "MERGED" ]; then break; fi
  if [ "$STATE" = "CLOSED" ]; then
    echo "❌ PR #$pr_number was closed without merging"
    exit 1
  fi

  EVENT=$(echo "$EVENT_JSON" | jq -r '.attributes."event.name" // ""')
  case "$EVENT" in
    github.check_suite.completed)
      # CI failed — diagnose via merge-blocker-diagnosis.md, push fix.
      ;;
    github.pr_review.submitted)
      # Bot reviewers (Codex, claude-code-review) are addressable inline;
      # humans require operator action. body.payload.author.type is "Bot" or "User".
      # Codex submits inline-thread reviews as state="commented", not
      # "changes_requested" — handle both via /catalyst-dev:review-comments,
      # which addresses the code AND resolves threads via the GraphQL
      # resolveReviewThread mutation.
      AUTHOR_TYPE=$(echo "$EVENT_JSON" | jq -r '.body.payload.author.type // "User"')
      if [ "$AUTHOR_TYPE" = "Bot" ]; then
        /catalyst-dev:review-comments "$pr_number"
      fi
      ;;
    github.push)
      gh pr update-branch "$pr_number" || true
      ;;
    "")
      # Timeout — gh api check above confirmed we're not merged.
      # Diagnose blockers per the reference doc.
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**Why every wake-up runs `gh api`:** if the orch-monitor daemon is down,
no GitHub webhook events flow into the log and `wait-for` blocks until
timeout (600 s). The `gh api` REST call after timeout is the safety net that keeps
merge confirmation correct even when the event stream has dropped. Same rule
applies on real event arrivals — events are wake-up triggers, never the
source of truth. Use `gh api` (REST), never `gh pr view --json` (GraphQL).

The reference doc contains:

- The GraphQL query (merge state + CI checks + review threads + reviews in one call)
- Blocker type table (`CLEAN`, `BEHIND`, `DIRTY`, `BLOCKED`, `DRAFT`, `UNSTABLE`, `HAS_HOOKS`,
  `UNKNOWN`)
- How to decompose `BLOCKED` into specific causes
- Resolution strategy for each blocker type:

| Blocker | Auto-resolution |
|---------|----------------|
| `branch-behind` (BEHIND) | `gh api -X PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/update-branch` (most repos disable GitHub's auto-update via `allow_update_branch: false`, so manual update is required), then continue polling |
| `conflicts` (DIRTY) | Attempt `gh pr checkout && git rebase origin/<base>`; if unresolvable, exit non-success with specific files |
| `draft` | `gh pr ready` |
| `ci-failing` (UNSTABLE / failing checks) | Analyze failure logs, fix code, push, continue polling |
| `unresolved-threads` | Run `/review-comments` (see `review-thread-resolution.md`); push fixes; continue polling for new comments |
| `changes-requested` | Check if addressed; suggest re-request review |
| `review-required` | Cannot fix — exit non-success and report how many approvals needed and who to request |
| `hooks-pending` (HAS_HOOKS) | Wait one cadence cycle and re-query |
| `unknown-blocker` (UNKNOWN) | Query branch protection rules, report every requirement with status |

The outer loop has a `MAX_ITER=20` cap to prevent runaway behaviour on a
stuck failure mode. Apply per-failure-type fix budgets inside each handler
(e.g., max 3 distinct fix attempts for the same CI failure mode). Exit
non-success only when a genuine human-gated blocker is identified
(unresolvable conflict, required reviewer, branch protection requirement that
cannot be satisfied).

When the loop confirms `state == "MERGED"`, capture `mergedAt` and proceed to step 7.

**Signal file write (when invoked from a worker context):** if `$SIGNAL_FILE` is set (oneshot or
orchestrator worker), write `pr.mergedAt`, `pr.ciStatus = "merged"`, and `status = "done"` to
the signal file as soon as `state == MERGED` is observed:

```bash
if [ -n "$SIGNAL_FILE" ] && [ -f "$SIGNAL_FILE" ]; then
  PR_MERGED_AT=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergedAt --jq '.mergedAt')
  jq --arg ts "$PR_MERGED_AT" \
    '.pr.ciStatus = "merged" | .pr.mergedAt = $ts | .status = "done" | .updatedAt = $ts | .completedAt = $ts' \
    "$SIGNAL_FILE" > "$SIGNAL_FILE.tmp" && mv "$SIGNAL_FILE.tmp" "$SIGNAL_FILE"
fi
```

### 7. Extract ticket reference

```bash
branch=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
title=$(gh pr view $pr_number --json title -q .title)

# From branch using configured team key
if [[ "$branch" =~ ($TEAM_KEY-[0-9]+) ]]; then
    ticket="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
fi

# From title if not in branch
if [[ -z "$ticket" ]] && [[ "$title" =~ ($TEAM_KEY-[0-9]+) ]]; then
    ticket="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
fi
```

### 8. Show merge summary

```
About to merge:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 PR:       #$pr_number - $title
 From:     $head_branch
 To:       $base_branch
 Commits:  $commit_count
 Files:    $file_count changed
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Merge:    $mergeStateStatus (CLEAN)
 Reviews:  $review_status
 CI:       $ci_status
 Tests:    ✅ Passed locally
 Ticket:   $ticket (will move to Done)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Merge strategy: Squash and merge

Proceed? [Y/n]:
```

### 9. Execute squash merge

```bash
# CTL-56: capture head ref + head repo BEFORE merge so we can delete the ref checkout-free
# after a REST-confirmed merge. Resolves from the PR API regardless of local branch state.
head_ref=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${pr_number}" --jq '.head.ref' 2>/dev/null || true)
head_repo=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${pr_number}" --jq '.head.repo.full_name' 2>/dev/null || true)
# Merge via REST only — no local branch-cleanup flag (CTL-56: the local side effect fails
# inside a linked worktree when the base is already checked out in the primary clone).
gh pr merge $pr_number --squash
```

**Always:**

- Squash merge (combines all commits into one)
- Remote branch deleted explicitly in Step 9b (checkout-free, after REST confirm)

**Capture merge commit SHA:**

```bash
merge_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 9b. Delete remote head ref (checkout-free)

After verifying the merge succeeded (REST confirm), delete the remote head branch via API —
no local `git checkout` required, safe from any worktree (CTL-56):

```bash
# Confirm the merge landed via REST BEFORE deleting anything. `gh pr merge` returning success is
# NOT proof it merged: with a merge queue enabled it only ENQUEUES the PR (see `gh pr merge --help`),
# so the head ref may still belong to a still-open PR. gh's old atomic delete-on-merge flag removed
# the branch ONLY after a real merge — preserve that conditional with an executable `.merged` check
# here (a prose "after verifying" step is not a gate). (CTL-56)
merged_ok=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${pr_number}" --jq '.merged' 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
# Delete the remote head ref checkout-free ONLY when BOTH hold:
#  - the merge is REST-confirmed (merged_ok == true), and
#  - the head branch actually lives in ${REPO}. A fork PR's `.head.ref` names a branch in the FORK,
#    so deleting repos/${REPO}/git/refs/heads/${head_ref} could hit a SAME-NAMED branch in the base
#    repo. gh's built-in flag handled the fork-vs-same-repo split natively; the raw API call does
#    not — so gate on `.head.repo.full_name == ${REPO}` (CTL-56).
# Idempotent + best-effort: a 404/422 means the ref is already gone or protected; never fail the
# skill on branch cleanup — the merge already landed.
if [[ "$merged_ok" == "true" && -n "${head_ref:-}" && "${head_repo:-}" == "${REPO}" ]]; then
  # CTL-56: URL-encode the head ref (preserve '/') so a metacharacter like '#' in a branch name
  # (e.g. feature#123) can't truncate the endpoint into deleting the wrong ref.
  enc_ref=$(printf '%s' "$head_ref" | jq -sRr @uri | sed 's|%2F|/|g')
  gh api --method DELETE "repos/${REPO}/git/refs/heads/${enc_ref}" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    || echo "CTL-56: remote branch ${head_ref} delete skipped (already gone or protected)" >&2
elif [[ "$merged_ok" != "true" ]]; then
  echo "merge-pr: merge of #${pr_number} not REST-confirmed; skipping branch cleanup (CTL-56)" >&2
fi
```

### 10. Update Linear ticket

If ticket found and not using `--no-update`:

```bash
# Use the shared transition helper (CTL-69). It reads stateMap from
# `.catalyst/config.json`, is idempotent, and silently skips when the
# linearis CLI is not installed.
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/linear-transition.sh" \
  --ticket "$ticket_id" --transition done --config .catalyst/config.json

# Then add a comment with PR number, merge commit, and base branch.
# Use `linearis comments usage` for exact syntax. Skip silently if CLI missing.
```

### 11. Delete local branch and update base

```bash
# CTL-56: detect linked-worktree — when absolute-git-dir ≠ git-common-dir we are in a
# linked worktree. In that case, skip the local `git checkout <base>` (it fails when
# the base is already checked out in the primary clone) and rely on Step 11a to update
# the primary. Defer the local feature-branch delete to teardown/reaper.
# NOTE: both sides MUST be absolute for the comparison to be valid. `--git-common-dir`
# returns a RELATIVE `.git` in the primary clone, which would falsely differ from the
# always-absolute `--absolute-git-dir` and misfire the guard in the primary. Force
# absolute with `--path-format=absolute` so the guard is TRUE only in a real worktree.
_abs_git="$(git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir 2>/dev/null || true)"
_com_git="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null || true)"
if [[ -n "$_abs_git" && -n "$_com_git" && "$_abs_git" != "$_com_git" ]]; then
  echo "merge-pr: linked worktree — skipping local base checkout; teardown handles branch cleanup (CTL-56)" >&2
else
  # Primary (non-worktree) checkout: switch to base, pull, delete local feature branch.
  # Switch to base branch
  git checkout $base_branch

  # Pull latest (includes merge commit)
  git pull origin $base_branch

  # Delete local feature branch
  git branch -d $head_branch

  # Confirm deletion
  echo "✅ Deleted local branch: $head_branch"
fi
```

**Always delete local branch** when not in a linked worktree — no prompt (remote deleted in Step 9b).

### 11a. Update primary worktree

If running in a git worktree, the primary checkout of main may be stale. Update it:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pull-primary-worktree.sh" --branch "$base_branch"
```

### 12. Extract post-merge tasks

**Read PR description:**

```bash
desc_file="thoughts/shared/prs/${pr_number}_description.md"
if [ -f "$desc_file" ]; then
    # Extract "Post-Merge Tasks" section
    tasks=$(sed -n '/## Post-Merge Tasks/,/^##/p' "$desc_file" | grep -E '^\- \[')
fi
```

**If tasks exist:**

```
📋 Post-merge tasks from PR description:
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Monitor error rates in production
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

Save these tasks? [Y/n]:
```

If yes:

```bash
# Save to thoughts
cat > "thoughts/shared/post_merge_tasks/${ticket}_tasks.md" <<EOF
# Post-Merge Tasks: $ticket

Merged: $(date)
PR: #$pr_number

$tasks
EOF

humanlayer thoughts sync
```

### 12b. Compound closing ritual (CTL-189 / CTL-813 / CTL-831)

Two learning steps run for every merged ticket, in order:

1. **Estimation actuals** — invoke `/catalyst-dev:compound-estimate $ticket_id`. It prompts for
   the post-merge re-score (CTL-746 scale: XS=1 S=3 M=5 L=8 XL=13) plus two short reflections,
   appends the weekly compound-log entry (`thoughts/shared/retros/estimate/`), and offers a
   corpus refresh when the reference-class corpus is stale. That entry is what
   `refresh-corpus.sh` feeds back into `reference-class-corpus.json` as human ground truth —
   skipping it is how the loop falls open again.
2. **Cross-ticket retro** — invoke `/catalyst-dev:ticket-retro` (no arguments). It regenerates
   `thoughts/shared/retros/ticket/<today>.md` over the since-last-retro window (same-day re-runs
   are cumulative) and refreshes the watch-items the morning briefing surfaces.

**Off the critical path**: if the user declines, the ticket was never estimated, or either skill
errors, log one line and continue — never block the merge ritual on them.

### 13. Detect Deployments and Report Success

After branch cleanup, check if the merge triggered any deployment workflows:

```bash
# Check for workflow runs triggered by the merge commit on the base branch
DEPLOY_RUNS=$(gh run list --branch "$base_branch" --limit 5 --json name,status,workflowName,url \
  --jq '.[] | select(.status == "in_progress" or .status == "queued")' 2>/dev/null)

if [[ -n "$DEPLOY_RUNS" ]]; then
  echo ""
  echo "Active workflow runs detected after merge:"
  gh run list --branch "$base_branch" --limit 5 --json workflowName,status,url \
    --jq '.[] | select(.status == "in_progress" or .status == "queued") | "  - \(.workflowName): \(.status) (\(.url))"'
  echo ""
  echo "Tip: Monitor deployment with:"
  echo "  /loop 3m gh run list --branch $base_branch --limit 3 --json workflowName,status,conclusion --jq '.[]'"
  echo ""
else
  echo ""
  echo "No active deployment workflows detected."
fi
```

Display the standard success summary after this check:

```

## Flags

**`--skip-tests`** - Skip local test execution

```bash
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --skip-tests
```

**`--no-update`** - Don't update Linear ticket

```bash
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --no-update
```

**`--keep-branch`** - Don't delete local branch

```bash
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --keep-branch
```

**Combined:**

```bash
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --skip-tests --no-update
```

## Error Handling

For all errors, provide clear messages with the specific error, what went wrong, and how to fix it.
**Never give up with a generic message** — always diagnose the specific cause and provide actionable
next steps.

**Fail fast (stop execution):**

- Rebase conflicts → show conflicting files, instructions to resolve manually, then re-run
  `/catalyst-dev:merge-pr`
- Test failures → show failed tests, suggest fix or `--skip-tests`
- PR not open/mergeable → show current state

**Diagnose and attempt to fix (step 6 blocker loop):**

- CI checks failing → analyze failure, attempt code fix, re-push, re-poll
- Unresolved threads → run `/review-comments`, resolve threads
- Branch behind → rebase and push
- Draft PR → mark as ready
- Changes requested → check if addressed, suggest re-request review
- Infrastructure failures → suggest re-run, provide log URL

**Escalate with specifics (never generic):**

- Review required → tell user exactly how many approvals needed and who to request
- Unresolvable conflicts → list specific files and what conflicts exist
- Unknown blockers → query branch protection rules and list every requirement with its status

**Never suggest:**

- Force merge, admin override, or disabling branch protection
- Skipping required checks or reviews
- Any workaround that bypasses the protection rather than satisfying it

**Warn but continue (graceful degradation):**

- Linearis CLI not found → warn, suggest install, merge proceeds
- Linear API error → warn, merge proceeds
- Branch deletion error → warn, merge already succeeded

## Configuration

Uses `.catalyst/config.json`:

```json
{
  "catalyst": {
    "project": {
      "ticketPrefix": "PROJ"
    },
    "linear": {
      "teamKey": "PROJ",
      "stateMap": {
        "done": "Done"
      }
    },
    "pr": {
      "defaultMergeStrategy": "squash",
      "deleteRemoteBranch": true,
      "deleteLocalBranch": true,
      "updateLinearOnMerge": true,
      "requireApproval": false,
      "requireCI": false,
      "testCommand": "make test"
    }
  }
}
```

State names are read from `stateMap` with sensible defaults. See `.catalyst/config.json` for all
keys.

## Examples

```bash
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123              # Merge PR for current branch
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --skip-tests # Skip local test execution
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --no-update  # Don't update Linear ticket
/catalyst-dev:merge-pr 123 --keep-branch # Don't delete local branch
```

## Safety Features

**Never bypass branch protection:**

- No `--admin`, `--force`, or any flag that circumvents protection rules
- No disabling or modifying branch protection rules
- No suggesting the user disable protections
- Always satisfy requirements legitimately or escalate with specifics

**Fail fast on:**

- Merge conflicts (can't auto-resolve)
- Test failures (unless --skip-tests)
- Rebase conflicts
- PR not in mergeable state

**Diagnose and fix automatically:**

- CI failures → analyze errors, fix code, push, re-poll
- Unresolved review threads → run `/review-comments`, resolve via GraphQL
- Branch behind → rebase and push
- Draft PR → mark as ready with `gh pr ready`

**Escalate with actionable specifics:**

- Review required → who to request, how many needed
- Changes requested → what was asked, whether commits address it
- Unknown blockers → full branch protection rule breakdown

**Always automated:**

- Rebase if behind (no conflicts)
- Squash merge
- Delete remote branch
- Delete local branch
- Update Linear to Done (if Linearis available)
- Pull latest base branch

**Graceful degradation:**

- If Linearis not installed, warn but continue
- Merge succeeds regardless of Linear integration

## Remember:

- **Never bypass branch protection** — diagnose and resolve blockers legitimately
- **Always squash merge** — clean history
- **Always delete branches** — no orphan branches
- **Always run tests** — unless explicitly skipped
- **Auto-rebase** — keep up-to-date with base
- **Diagnose, don't give up** — identify specific blockers and fix or explain them
- **Update Linear** — move ticket to Done automatically (if Linearis available)
- **Graceful degradation** — work without Linearis if needed
- For Linearis CLI syntax, see the `linearis` skill reference
