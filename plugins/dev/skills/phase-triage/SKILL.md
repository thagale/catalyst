name: phase-triage
description: Phase agent that triages a Linear ticket — expands acronyms, classifies (feature/bug/docs/refactor/chore), identifies genuine blockers (a semantic second-pass over the backlog — NOT a prose scrape; CTL-838), estimates scope, writes triage.json, and posts a triage analysis comment to Linear. Triage completion is signaled by that comment plus the local triage.json — there is no `triaged` label. Emits phase.triage.complete.<TICKET> on success and phase.triage.failed.<TICKET> on error. Dispatched by the phase-agent orchestrator (CTL-452) via slash command — `user-invocable: true` so the dispatcher's `claude --bg "/catalyst-dev:phase-triage ..."` resolves.

# phase-triage

Greenfield phase agent shipped in CTL-451 (Initiative 1 Phase 5). Reads a Linear ticket, produces a
structured triage analysis, and lands the analysis as a Linear comment + label so subsequent phase
agents (research, plan, …) can rely on the classification.

The skill is dispatched in two modes:

- **Production**: An Opus phase agent reads `triage.json` placeholder fields produced by the bash
  body below, then refines them with model-quality analysis (acronym expansion, judgment-of-scope,
  dep inference) before the comment is posted.
- **CI / test runner**: The bash body alone is self-sufficient — it derives all five fields
  deterministically from the ticket JSON so e2e tests run without a model call.

Both modes produce the same `triage.json` shape and emit the same canonical phase event.

## Use-case conformance (Opus mode)

When refining the analysis, also assess whether the ticket meets the `/catalyst-dev:gherkin-ticket`
standard: an outcome-first title (not a mechanism/file/symbol name) and a body that opens with a
plain-English use case followed by tiered Gherkin acceptance criteria. If it does **not** conform,
add one line to the triage analysis comment flagging it — e.g. _"⚠️ Ticket does not lead with a
use-case (per gherkin-ticket); consider rewriting the title/opening for scannability."_ This
surfaces non-conformant tickets for the operator without auto-rewriting them — triage is a
documentarian, so **do not** edit the ticket's title or description here; flag only. (The
deterministic bash body and `triage.json` schema are unchanged.)

## /goal

```
/goal "I have written ${WORKER_DIR}/triage.json populated with all five fields —
       classification (feature|bug|docs|refactor|chore), estimated_scope,
       acronyms_expanded, dependencies, and a non-empty summary — refined with
       real analysis (not just the deterministic placeholders), AND posted the
       triage analysis comment to the Linear ticket, AND printed the triage.json
       path on stdout."
```

CTL-656: the `/goal` evaluator keeps the agent working until the triage is genuinely complete —
every field populated and the Linear comment posted — instead of emitting the first-pass
deterministic placeholder and exiting. A real blocker (unreadable ticket, a Linear 4xx on the
comment) surfaces as needs-input rather than a silently-thin `triage.json`. (Production/Opus mode
only; the CI bash body is self-sufficient and does not invoke the evaluator.)

## Triage completion signal

Triage completion is recorded by two artifacts, not a Linear label: the analysis comment this skill
posts to the ticket, and the local `triage.json` the coordinator reads (`hasTriageArtifact`). There
is no `triaged` workspace label — the daemon never writes one.

## Inputs

Environment:

- `TICKET` — Linear identifier (e.g. `CTL-451`). Required; falls back to `CATALYST_TICKET` (the
  env the dispatcher actually sets — CTL-1441).
- `WORKER_DIR` — output directory for `triage.json`. Defaults to `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}`,
  else the canonical `~/catalyst/execution-core/workers/${TICKET}` — NEVER `$(pwd)` (a triage.json
  outside the worker dir is invisible to the monitor and re-triages forever; CTL-1441/CTL-1403).
- `ORCH_DIR` — falls back to `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR`. `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID`,
  `CATALYST_SESSION_ID` — used for trace/span id derivation in the emitted event; optional.

# 2d. Dependencies — DELIBERATELY EMPTY in the deterministic path (CTL-838).
#     Catalyst does NOT infer dependencies from prose. The old behavior scraped
#     every TEAM-NNN token out of the title+description and the scheduler (CTL-755
#     STEP E) persisted each as a durable `blocked_by` edge — turning prior-art
#     mentions, incident examples, "see also" references and cross-team ids into
#     FALSE blockers that deadlocked tickets against work they do not depend on.
#     Real prerequisites are first-class, captured two ways, NEVER by scraping:
#       1. The ticket AUTHOR sets formal Linear `blocked_by` LINKS at creation time
#          (see the gherkin-ticket / linear / create-tickets skills). Those are
#          already durable Linear relations the scheduler honors directly.
#       2. An Opus-mode triage pass acts as a SECOND PAIR OF EYES — it examines the
#          backlog and records only GENUINE missed blockers (see "2c" below).
#     The bash fallback therefore emits an empty list (safe: no false blocks). It
#     must never reintroduce a regex over mentioned ids.
DEPENDENCIES="[]"

# 2e. Summary — first paragraph of prose, trimmed.
#     Skip leading markdown headers (^#+\s+) and bullet markers (^[-*+]\s+) so a
#     description that opens with "## Problem" yields the first sentence of prose,
#     not the literal header. Falls back to an empty summary if the description is
#     entirely headers/bullets/blank lines.
#     Implemented as a pure-bash loop rather than awk: awk's whole-line field is a
#     bare positional token, which Claude Code's slash-command arg substitution
#     would rewrite to the ticket id at dispatch, turning every line into broken
#     awk arithmetic (CTL-602). This loop uses only bash+zsh-safe constructs

## What an Opus-mode invocation adds

The bash body above is fully self-sufficient — the e2e test exercises only that. When an Opus agent
runs this skill, it should:

1. Run the bash body to produce the baseline `triage.json` and Linear comment.

2. Read the ticket back, refine the classification + scope estimate with model-quality judgement,
   and re-write `triage.json` if anything changed.

**2b. Anchor a numeric estimate against the reference class (CTL-751, CTL-954).**

The goal is ONE numeric estimate written in the team's configured scale (fibonacci / tShirt /
exponential / linear — whatever `issueEstimation.type` the team has set in Linear).

**Step 1 (preferred): reference-class lookup.** Run:

```bash
bun "${REPO_ROOT}/plugins/pm/scripts/estimate/reference-class-lookup.ts" \
  --corpus "${REPO_ROOT}/plugins/pm/scripts/estimate/reference-class-corpus.json" \
  --title "<ticket title>" --json
```

where `REPO_ROOT` is the repo root (the worktree's checkout path, e.g. the directory containing
`plugins/`). Parse `reference_class.points` from the JSON output.

**Step 2 (fallback when Step 1 errors or returns nothing): scope → method mapping.** Fetch the
team's estimation method with a single GraphQL call:

```bash
# Token via the shared secret contract (CTL-1616) — never a hand-rolled
# LINEAR_API_TOKEN/LINEAR_API_KEY ladder.
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/catalyst-secret-contract.sh"
catalyst_resolve_secret linear-api-token >/dev/null
curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: ${CATALYST_SECRET_LAST_VALUE}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query($k:String!){teams(filter:{key:{eq:$k}}){nodes{issueEstimation{type allowZero extended}}}}", "variables":{"k":"<TEAM_KEY>"}}' \
  | jq -r '.data.teams.nodes[0].issueEstimation.type'
```

Map the bash-body's `estimated_scope` to the method's scale using this table (select the column
matching the team's `type`):

| scope  | fibonacci | tShirt | exponential | linear |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| xs     | 1         | 0 (XS) | 1           | 1      |
| small  | 1         | 1 (S)  | 1           | 1      |
| medium | 3         | 2 (M)  | 2           | 2      |
| large  | 5         | 3 (L)  | 4           | 3      |
| epic   | 8         | 5 (XL) | 8           | 5      |

Write the result to `triage.json` as **both** `"estimate": <points>` AND
`"estimateMethod": "<type>"` (e.g. `"estimateMethod": "tShirt"`). The scheduler reads
`estimateMethod` to validate the value against the correct scale without a second network call.

If both Step 1 and Step 2 fail, leave `triage.json` without an `estimate` field — the coordinator
skips the Linear estimate write for this ticket (fail-open; forward progress is unaffected). The
bash body intentionally does **not** write `estimate` (CTL-558 guard).

**2c. Identify genuine blockers — semantic second-pass, READ-ONLY (CTL-838).** Catalyst does **not**
parse or infer dependencies from the description text. The bash body writes an empty `dependencies`
list by design (CTL-838 killed the old `2d` regex scrape). Real prerequisites come from two places,
and your job here is the second one:

1. **Formal author links (primary).** The agent that authored the ticket records its real
   prerequisites as Linear `blocked_by` LINKS at creation time (the gherkin-ticket / linear /
   create-tickets skills now instruct this). Those are already durable Linear relations and the
   admission gate honors them directly from the live graph — triage does **not** need to re-derive
   or re-emit them.

2. **Triage as a SECOND PAIR OF EYES (your job).** You are NOT a parser. Do **not** add a dependency
   because an id appears in the prose. Instead: read the ticket's intent, then **examine the
   relevant backlog** — query the replica for the ticket's team / area, and read any candidate
   ticket, via direct SQL (see the `linearis` skill's "Reading Linear" section) — and judge whether
   any in-flight or planned work is a **true prerequisite the author may have missed**: work that
   must reach a terminal state
   before this ticket can sensibly start (a shared interface not yet built, a migration that must
   land first, an explicit "must follow" sequencing). Record **only** blockers you can justify, in
   the rich shape with a `reason`:

```jsonc
"dependencies": [
  { "id": "CTL-123", "exists": true, "blockerState": "Implement", "reason": "defines the API this ticket consumes" }
]
```

If you find no genuine missed blocker, leave `dependencies` as the empty list the bash body wrote. A
mention is not a dependency; a shared topic is not a dependency; "see also / prior art / regression
of / example" is not a dependency. When in doubt, leave it out — a false blocker deadlocks real
work, a missed one is caught on the next pass.

**Hard constraint — the skill makes ZERO Linear writes for dependencies.** Do NOT call
`linearis issues update ... --blocked-by` (or any `linearis issues update`) from this skill. The
admission gate's durable `blocked_by` persistence lives in the execution-core scheduler (CTL-755
STEP E, `scheduler.mjs` — it reads `triage.json.dependencies`, re-validates each id via
`fetchTicketState`, and drops unresolvable / terminal / cycle-closing / **parent-epic (CTL-878)** /
**cross-team (CTL-838)** ids before writing the durable edge with `applyBlockedByRelation`). Keeping
the write scheduler-side preserves the CTL-497/CTL-558 contract — the phase-triage e2e negative
guard fails the build if this skill ever emits a `linearis issues update` call.
The replica SQL reads above (ticket detail + backlog scan) are read-only and are fine. STEP E
tolerates BOTH the flat-string and the rich `{id}` shapes.

3. If the refined fields differ materially, post a follow-up `linearis issues discuss` comment
   marking the refinement.

The refinement step is deliberately optional — the orchestrator hand-off in CTL-452 only needs the
`phase.triage.complete.<TICKET>` event, and the bash body already emits that.

## Structured escalation (CTL-1065)

If triage genuinely cannot proceed (e.g., the ticket description is too
ambiguous to classify, or a required external resource is unavailable), emit
`failed` with a structured `explanation` block. Use the CLI shim:

```bash
EXPL_JSON="$(node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/execution-core/escalation-explain.mjs" \
  --ticket "$TICKET" --phase triage \
  --what-failed "{{ specific symptom }}" \
  --why-gave-up "{{ reason autonomous triage cannot complete }}" \
  --human-question "{{ one specific answerable question }}" \
  2>/dev/null || echo '{}')"
```

The `human_question` MUST be specific and answerable — never:
- "needs a human" / "requires human review"
- "a human must decide" / "escalate to operator"

Write the specific question instead:
- Good: "should CTL-NNN be classified as a feature or a refactor — the
  description mentions both adding a new API and removing the old one?"
