#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shell unit tests for the CTL-1502 forwarder/watchdog supervision surface in
# plugins/dev/scripts/catalyst-monitor.sh. Covers the three Codex P1 fixes that
# live in bash (the JS-side ones are covered by the bun suites):
#
#   1. Node-class gating — catalyst-stack starts the STANDALONE watchdog on a
#      monitor node (otel-forward without execution-core) and never on a worker
#      (where startDaemon arms the in-daemon probe), so exactly one supervisor
#      exists per forwarder in either topology.
#   2. PID identity — read_forward_pid / read_watchdog_pid must not report a
#      RECYCLED pid as live, or an enforced restart would SIGTERM/SIGKILL an
#      unrelated same-user process. Fails CLOSED when ps cannot answer.
#   3. Lock discipline — the forwarder mutation lock is atomic (mkdir), reaps a
#      dead owner's stale lock, and its INT/TERM handler EXITS rather than
#      returning (a returning handler lets an aborted restart resume into the
#      start half and relaunch the forwarder after shutdown was requested).
#
# Follows the __tests__/catalyst-deployment-mode.test.sh conventions
# (ok/fail/expect_eq, PASSES/FAILURES exit code).
#
# Run: bash plugins/dev/scripts/__tests__/daemon-watchdog-supervision.test.sh
