// respond-ticket.mjs — the read-model's SECOND write endpoint (CTL-924, BFF12).
//
// HOME5's Inbox `Answer / Unblock` verb needs a read-model WRITE that does three
// things to a HELD ticket and then hands control back to the daemon:
//
//   1. RECORD the operator's response (their answer / unblock note) so the human's
//      input is durable — written as a `.respond-<phase>.json` artifact in the
//      ticket's worker dir AND carried in the resume event's payload (the unified
//      event log is the system-wide record).
//   2. CLEAR the `needs-human` label + the `.linear-label-needs-human.applied`
//      once-marker. This is the exact inverse of the daemon's labelOnce guard
//      (execution-core/label-guard.mjs clearStalledLabel, CTL-646): the label is
//      removed from Linear AND the marker deleted, together, so the daemon's apply
//      guard re-arms and a stale-label / stale-marker split-brain can't form.
//   3. TRIGGER re-dispatch — CTL-876's resume loop. The daemon already resumes a
//      parked (`status:"needs-input"`) worker on a `linear.comment.created` event
//      for the ticket (execution-core/daemon.mjs handleCommentWake, CTL-549): it
//      removes the held label and re-dispatches the parked phase with its handoff.
//      So this endpoint emits ONE canonical `linear.comment.created` event into
//      the unified event log carrying the operator's response as the comment body.
//      The monitor NEVER calls dispatchTicket directly — it stays on the
//      "UI triggers, the daemon dispatches" side of the boundary (the same shape
//      BFF8's stop endpoint keeps: it issues the kill, it does not own the daemon).
//
// SHARED MUTATION FOUNDATION with BFF8 (stop-worker.mjs): this endpoint reuses
// stop-worker's typed-confirm gate + fence-check scaffolding verbatim
// (runFenceCheck / readClusterHostCount are imported, not re-implemented) so the
// two web writes never diverge. The optimistic-rollback contract is identical —
// the endpoint returns the verbatim { ticket, phase } identity + a `resuming`
// status the client marks optimistically and rolls back against the next board
// frame (the held label/row should clear within the rollback window).
//
// FENCE-AWARE (multi-node requirement, CTL-863/864): before mutating, the
// endpoint passes the run signal's generation through the cross-host fence-check.
// A request whose generation is behind the current fence (fence-check exit 10 =
// stale) is REJECTED and NOTHING is mutated — a partitioned / stale node cannot
// unblock a ticket the cluster has taken over. SINGLE-HOST (hosts.json absent /
// length <= 1) is an identity NO-OP pass: the fence-check never spawns, the
// response is recorded and the ticket resumed normally with zero added latency.
//
// READ-then-ACT, fail-safe: no held run signal for the ticket → 404 (nothing to
// answer); a verified-stale fence → 409 fenced; an indeterminate multi-host fence
// → 409 (do NOT mutate on an unconfirmed fence — the conservative answer for a
// write). All collaborators (signal read, fence-check, label clear, response
// record, event emit) are injectable so the route + unit tests drive every branch
// without a real worker dir, a real hosts.json, a real `linearis`, or a real
// event log.
