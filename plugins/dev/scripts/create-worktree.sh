#!/bin/bash
# create-worktree.sh - Create a git worktree for isolated development
# Usage: ./create-worktree.sh [worktree_name] [base_branch] [--worktree-dir <path>] [--hooks-json <json>] [--orchestration <name>] [--reuse-existing] [--skip-fetch]
#
# Options:
#   --worktree-dir <path>       Override worktree base directory (used by orchestrator)
#   --hooks-json <json>         JSON array of setup hook commands to run after creation
#   --orchestration <name>      Set orchestration run name in workflow context
#   --reuse-existing            If the worktree already exists, skip creation/setup
#                               and succeed. Makes the script idempotent for tab-config
#                               launchers that re-open a long-lived worktree (e.g. "pm").
#   --skip-fetch                Do not fetch the base branch from origin before
#                               creating the worktree. Use for offline or
#                               test-isolated invocations; the new branch will
#                               be rooted on the local <base_branch> tip.

# catalyst_git_exclude_worktree_artifacts <worktree_path> — keep Catalyst's own
# worktree-local runtime bookkeeping out of every project's git status, without
# ever touching that project's TRACKED .gitignore. Mirrors the existing pattern
# already used for .agents/ (codex-run-phase-agent.mjs's gitExcludeAgents +
# resolveGitExcludePath): writes to this worktree's LOCAL, uncommitted
# `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`, so it applies only here, never
# leaks into the project's history, and needs no per-project PR.
#
# Before this, every onboarded project had to carry its own .gitignore entries
# for these paths — miss one and `git status` shows Catalyst's own noise as
# dirty, which is exactly what stalled a real ticket's verify phase (rebase
# refused a "dirty" tree that was only dirty because of thoughts/ and
# .catalyst/.workflow-context.json). Idempotent + best-effort: failures here
# must never abort worktree creation.
