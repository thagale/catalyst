// fence-guard.mjs — shared stale-generation guard for external-write sites (CTL-863 Phase 4).
//
// fenceGuard is called BEFORE each of the 10 daemon-side external-write sites
// (Linear/GitHub writes). On a ≥2-host cluster, a paused/partitioned zombie that
// wakes up after another host took over should NOT be allowed to corrupt Linear
// state. The guard reads this ticket's claimed generation from its signal file and
// asks fenceCheckSyncCached if we're still the current owner. FAIL-CLOSED: any
// failure (missing signal, spawn error, stale gen) returns false → suppress the write.
//
// SINGLE-HOST is a guaranteed no-op: multiHost:false → return true without calling
// check. This is the common case (most installs are single-host), so the guard
// adds zero cost in the steady state.
//
// fenceCheckSyncCached (not the raw fenceCheckSync) is the default `check` — an
// in-process TTL cache (default 45s, CATALYST_FENCE_READ_CACHE_MS) around the
// underlying `query ReadFence` read, added as an URGENT interim fix: on a
// multi-host cluster this guard's own read volume (~5,000/hr across all sites)
// was saturating the shared Linear app-actor bucket and freezing dispatch via
// the CTL-679 breaker. See cluster-claim-sync.mjs for the full rationale; the
// cache changes read volume only, never fenceGuard's fail-closed decision.
//
// ⚠️ HARD SAFETY CAVEAT — projection-first is NEVER safe on an N>1 roster without
// the Stage-1 cross-host reconcile store. A PER-HOST broker projection cannot
// carry a FOREIGN host's takeover generation bump, so a partitioned-but-alive
// zombie keeps heartbeat-re-emitting its OWN fence: its local projection reads
// self-owned + FRESH and the guard would fail OPEN — the exact partitioned-zombie
// write the fence exists to suppress. `claimedAtAgeMs` freshness CANNOT mitigate
// this: the zombie is alive and refreshing its own `claimed_at`, so the row never
// looks stale. Therefore fenceGuard REFUSES CATALYST_FENCE_READ_SOURCE=
// "projection-first" on a multi-host roster unless the Stage-1 capability marker
// (CATALYST_FENCE_STAGE1_STORE) is present, falling back to the authoritative
// "linear" read + a loud warning. Do NOT arm projection-first on >1 hosts until
// Stage 1 (fence-store.mjs + broker cross-host reconcile) is reviewed + merged.

// A ≥2-host roster can be superseded by a peer's takeover, so we must NOT
// silently trust local state. The read source is selected by
// CATALYST_FENCE_READ_SOURCE:
//
//   "linear" (DEFAULT, Stage 0) — escalate to the authoritative read
//     (fenceCheckSyncCached: the #2552 interim cache over `query ReadFence`).
//     This is today's exact behavior. The projection-first fast path is NOT
//     armed for multi-host because a PER-HOST broker projection cannot carry a
//     FOREIGN host's takeover bump (spec's fatal finding 1) — trusting it would
//     fail OPEN for the exact partitioned-zombie case the fence exists to catch.
//     Arming it safely requires the cross-host reconcile store (spec Stage 1),
//     which is a separate, fleet-reviewed change.
//
//   "projection-first" (Stage 1, opt-in) — read the broker projection; trust a
//     FRESH self-owned + generation-matching row (claimed_at-age < FENCE_FRESH_MS);
//     a fresh row showing a foreign owner (incl. a released→null owner) or a higher
//     generation → suppress; a stale/absent row → escalate to the authoritative
//     read (migration-safe fallback, no fence gap). ONLY safe once the broker
//     reconciles foreign fence rows cross-host (Stage 1) — until then it MUST NOT
//     be the fleet default. GUARDRAIL: on a multi-host roster this mode is
//     HARD-REFUSED (falls back to "linear" + a loud warning) unless the Stage-1
//     capability marker CATALYST_FENCE_STAGE1_STORE is set, so an operator cannot
//     arm the unsafe fast path before Stage 1 exists.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED for the mutating write sites: a missing generation or any thrown
// error → false (suppress the side-effect). ESCALATION write sites pass
// proceedOnMissingGeneration:true to fail OPEN (log loud + write) on a missing
// generation, so a needs-human escalation is never silently dropped. All
