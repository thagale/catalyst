// secret-contract.mjs — CTL-1616: the canonical secret registry + resolution engine.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The 2026-08-02 fleet 401 outage was four divergent hand-written
// copies of one secret-resolution chain (CTL-1612 fixed the github-token/webhook-secret
// instance). Every OTHER secret in the fleet inventory is still the pre-CTL-1612 failure
// class today: 9 files/12 sites hand-roll `LINEAR_API_TOKEN ?? LINEAR_API_KEY`, 3 divergent
// Linear OAuth-mint Layer-2 fallback chains, 2 divergent CATALYST_CLOUD_TOKEN name
// resolvers, 2 divergent GROQ_API_KEY ladders, 6 divergent Layer-2-path resolvers. This
// module is the ONE named secret contract every one of those call sites will eventually
// fold onto: a frozen registry of per-secret FACTS (§2 of the design), walked by a small
// closed provider-type ENGINE (~7 delivery-type cases whose bash/JS parity cost is fixed,
// not per-secret).
//
// THIS PR IS THE FIRST ISOLATION SLICE — ZERO CONSUMERS. Nothing outside this file's own
// tests imports it yet. cluster-sync.mjs's ENV_BACKED_SECRET_EXACT/isEnvBackedSecretFile,
// catalyst-secret-env.sh's catalyst_project_github_token/_webhook_secret, and
// github-auth-preflight.mjs's githubTokenFileCandidates/rearmGithubTokenFromFile are ALL
// left untouched here — re-pointing them onto this registry is later-PR work (CTL-1616
// design §9, PR1 proper). This file exists in isolation, exactly the way
// lib/deployment-mode.mjs (CTL-1617 PR1) landed before any consumer moved onto it.
//
// REGISTRY IS CODE, NOT JSON (design §2, judge-mandated). A runtime-jq-parsed
// secret-contract.json on the boot-critical path would convert six independently-divergent
// resolution chains into one CORRELATED single point of failure, and would reimport the
// bash-JSON fragility class the CTL-1617 parity work spent an entire remediation round
// documenting (a bare `// empty` swallows JSON `false`; NUL bytes die at the $() boundary;
// [[:space:]] is locale data; multi-document/BOM files parse differently per language).
// SECRET_REGISTRY is a frozen in-module data constant that both this file's engine AND
// lib/catalyst-secret-contract.sh's independently-maintained bash mirror encode — two
// physical copies, one logical source, held honest by the row-id-set-equality assertion in
// __tests__/secret-contract-parity.test.sh.
//
// ZERO-IMPORT LEAF (node:fs / node:os / node:path only) — same rationale as
// lib/deployment-mode.mjs: doctor.mjs runs under bare Node and must import this without
// pulling execution-core/config.mjs's bun:sqlite-reaching module graph. This also means the
// real rearm/mint IMPLEMENTATIONS (rearmGithubTokenFromFile, the linear-remint.mjs
// reminters) can never be baked into this leaf's static row data — they are registered
// AGAINST rows from execution-core, in a later PR, via registerRearmHook() below (design §3:
// "the mint action and rearm hooks stay in their execution-core homes ... and are registered
// against rows"). See the "REARM-HOOK SEAM" comment on registerRearmHook for how PR1 proves
// that seam works before any real hook exists.
//
// NAMING RULE, mirrored from lib/deployment-mode.mjs: every WARN/log/comment in this file
// says "deployment mode" fully qualified where it discusses CTL-1617's resolution object —
// never bare "mode" (this codebase already has 3 unrelated "mode" concepts).

      // see __tests__/secret-contract-parity.test.sh's "string-shape" / "newline-only"
      // cells):
      //
      // 1. A bare STRING value at a gated tier's path ALWAYS falls through, even when that
      //    string's own CONTENT happens to parse as JSON holding every required field (e.g.
      //    the tier stores '"{\"clientId\":\"x\",\"clientSecret\":\"y\"}"' — a STRING, not an
      //    object). meetsRequiredObjectFields's `typeof raw !== "object"` guard already
      //    rejects this on the JS side (raw is the untouched parsed value — a string is never
      //    reinterpreted as JSON here). The bash mirror needed an explicit fix for this: its
      //    _csc_meets_required_object_fields pipes the ALREADY-DECODED value back into `jq`
      //    for the field check, and jq happily re-parses a string's own text as JSON —
      //    incorrectly treating object-shaped string CONTENT as a winning object. The fix
      //    (_csc_config_json_tag_accepted) gates on the `_csc_read_json_string` TAG itself
      //    (@OBJ64: vs @STR64:) — which losslessly records the ORIGINAL value's type — instead
      //    of re-deriving type from decoded text, so a tagged-@STR64 value can never reach the
      //    object field-check at all when the row declares requiredObjectFields. (Empirically,
      //    the actual PRE-FOLD script does NEITHER "win" NOR "cleanly fall through" for this
      //    exact shape: `jq -r '.clientId // empty'` errors trying to index a string, and under
      //    the script's own `set -euo pipefail` that CRASHES the whole process (verified: exit
      //    5) rather than advancing to the next tier. "Falls through" is the safer canon this
      //    contract picks for both engines — matching current JS and never crashing — since a
      //    hard abort is not a reproducible-in-both-engines behavior to mirror.)
      //
      // 2. A field is "empty" (fails the gate) using the SAME trailing-EOL-stripped emptiness
      //    stripEol() already applies to bare-file values — NOT raw `.length > 0`. Pinned
      //    empirically: the OLD script's `CLIENT_ID=$(jq -r '...clientId // empty' "$FILE")`
      //    command-substitution silently strips ALL trailing newline bytes from jq's captured
      //    output, so a field holding the single character "\n" captures as CLIENT_ID="" and
      //    `[[ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]]` correctly advances to the next tier. A bare JS
      //    `raw[field].length > 0` check does NOT reproduce this (a lone "\n" has length 1 —
      //    JS previously WON a tier the old script would have advanced past). See

// _csc_read_json_string tags the identical input @NONSTR — a real parity divergence, caught
// by __tests__/secret-contract-parity.test.sh's hostile NUL-escape-in-JSON-string probe.
// Rejecting it HERE (not just at the transport boundary) means a NUL-containing config-json
// value degrades to "not found" identically in both languages, exactly like a non-string

// than a second copy.
// hasLiveLoneHighSurrogateEscape — CTL-1617 JSON-acceptance-normalization lesson, mirroring
// jq 1.7.1's OWN acceptance rule exactly rather than the earlier (over-rejecting) regex
// guard this replaces. Verified against real jq 1.7.1 (`jq --version` ⇒ jq-1.7.1-apple):
//   - a lone HIGH surrogate escape (\uD800-\uDBFF, unpaired) ⇒ jq exits 5, rejects the WHOLE
//     document.
//   - a lone LOW surrogate escape (\uDC00-\uDFFF, unpaired) ⇒ jq exits 0 and substitutes
//     U+FFFD for it — ACCEPTED, not rejected.
//   - a valid HIGH+LOW pair ⇒ accepted, forms the intended astral character.
// So only a live, unpaired HIGH escape must reject the document; a live lone LOW is fine
// (handled at the value-extraction boundary below, via toWellFormed()).
//
// "Live" is the key subtlety the old regex guard got wrong (E6): a backslash run of ODD
// length immediately before a `u` means the LAST backslash actually escapes that `u` (every
// preceding pair of backslashes is itself one escaped literal backslash) — a genuine
// \uXXXX escape. An EVEN-length run means every backslash pairs off as a literal backslash
// and the following "uXXXX" is ordinary LITERAL TEXT, not an escape at all — e.g. the JSON
// string source `"literal \\ud800 text"` (an escaped backslash followed by the 5 literal
// characters "ud800") parses to the harmless string `literal \ud800 text` and must NOT
// reject the document, even though the old regex — which only looked for a bare `\uXXXX`
// substring, blind to what preceded the backslash — matched it and killed the whole read.
//
// Scans the RAW file text (before JSON.parse), matching jq's whole-document rejection
// semantics: a live unpaired HIGH escape ANYWHERE in the document — even outside the field
// being read — is what makes jq unable to produce ANY value from the file at all.

// REARM-HOOK SEAM (design §3/§6, Open Question 4). The row shape's `rearmHook` field in
// design §2's pseudocode cannot live ON the frozen row object in THIS leaf: the real
// implementations (rearmGithubTokenFromFile, the linear-remint.mjs cooldown reminters) live
// in execution-core and would violate the zero-import contract if baked in here, and PR1 is
// explicitly zero-consumer — nothing has registered a hook yet. So the seam is realized as a
// separate, explicitly MUTABLE side table (`_rearmHooks`), kept OUT of the frozen registry,
// that a later PR populates via registerRearmHook(id, fn) from execution-core — exactly where
// design §3 says the hook implementations belong ("registered against rows"). This table is
// EMPTY for every row in this PR; see armSecret's degrade behavior below for what that means
// in practice, and secret-contract.test.mjs's "registry validation (§6)" suite for the tests
// that prove both halves of the mechanism (hookless degrade, and hook-present pickup) work
// correctly before any real hook exists.
const _rearmHooks = new Map();

// registerRearmHook(id, fn) — attach an in-process rearm implementation to a row. Returns
// true on success, false (never throws) when: the id is unknown, the row's declared
// rotation.class is not "re-armable" (design §6 rule 2, the CAPABILITY-CEILING rule — a
// boot-only row's ceiling does not support an arm hook, registering one against it would be
// misleading), or fn is not a function.

// caller's arm baseline consults the identical provider chain its own direct resolveSecret
// calls use — see the DEPLOYMENT-MODE THREADING FIX comment on the hookless-degrade path
// below for the concrete failure this closes.
//
// TWO PATHS, per design §6:
//
// 1. HOOK PATH — rotation.class === "re-armable" AND a hook is currently registered
//    (registerRearmHook): the hook performs the actual in-process rearm (e.g. re-read the
//    shared file and update process.env, as rearmGithubTokenFromFile will once PR-of-a-later-
//    migration-step registers it). A successful in-process rearm never requires a restart —
//    that is the whole point of "re-armable". restartRequired is always false on this path.
//
// 2. HOOKLESS-DEGRADE PATH — every other case (boot-only rows, "n/a" rows, AND — this is the
//    PR1-specific state — every re-armable row that has NOT had a hook registered against it
//    yet, since nothing has in this isolation slice). Design §6 rule 1 says a hookless
//    re-armable row is "structurally forced boot-only" by a registry-validation test failing;
//    THIS implementation realizes that as a RUNTIME degrade instead of a load-time assertion,
//    because the real hooks are execution-core-owned and do not exist inside this zero-import
//    leaf yet — asserting their presence at registry-load time in PR1 would be asserting
//    something that is honestly not yet true. The degrade itself is the same shape armSecret
//    would give an actual boot-only row: resolve fresh, diff against the last-observed value,
//    and report restartRequired: true iff it changed — the literal Gherkin-Scenario-2
//    mechanism (design §6), proven correct here before any real hook exists. See
//    secret-contract.test.mjs's registry-validation suite for the explicit assertion that
//    every SEED re-armable row currently has NO hook registered (self-documenting: this list
//    must shrink as later PRs call registerRearmHook, and the test will need updating then —
//    that is by design, not an oversight).
export function armSecret(id, { env = process.env, deploymentMode } = {}) {

  // deploymentMode a caller threads through to direct resolveSecret() calls — omitting it
  // used to make the arm baseline resolve through the non-cloud file/config chain even in
  // genuine cloud mode, while a sibling direct resolveSecret(id, { env, deploymentMode })
  // call correctly resolved via the cloud-only env-alias chain. In a cloud process with an
  // injected token AND a stale local file, that mismatch made a stale-file edit falsely
  // report restartRequired while a REAL token rotation went unnoticed — the literal
  // "arm baselines the wrong provider chain" bug this fix closes. Passing deploymentMode
  // straight through (default: undefined, identical to resolveSecret's own default) means a
  // caller that never passes it gets EXACTLY today's non-cloud behavior — this only changes
  // behavior for a caller that already threads deploymentMode into armSecret.

    // to a baseline that did not exist yet.

  // restartRequired mirrors `rotated` exactly on this path: reaching here already means
  // either a genuine boot-only row OR a hookless re-armable row, and design §6 rule 1's
  // honesty requirement is that BOTH degrade identically (a consumer that never wires the
  // arm path must not appear safer than one that never could).
