# A branch serves $ticket when it IS the ticket (execution-core convention) or is
# EXACTLY "<orch-id>-<ticket>" (the legacy convention orchestrate-dispatch-next
# uses for ${WORKTREE_BASE}/${ORCH_ID}-${T}).
#
# CAT-31 review P1: the legacy arm used to be a bare `*-<ticket>` glob, which also
# matched any ordinary developer branch whose name happens to end in the ticket key
# — `fix-CAT-100`, `revert-CAT-100`, `wip-CAT-100`. Because the cwd-serving rung is
# consulted BEFORE the registry, dispatch standing in such a checkout would rebase
# and launch the worker there instead of the registered CAT-100 worktree, and strict
# mode would accept it as a legitimate source. A suffix alone does not establish
# orchestrator identity.
#
# There is no shape to pattern-match against: real orchestrator ids are arbitrary
# (`demo`, `exec-core-tracer`, `o-adv-1103-1088-...`, `ctl-123-126`). The only sound
# discriminator is the id itself, which every dispatch path already has — the
# dispatchers export CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID, and phase-agent-dispatch keeps it in
# ORCH_ID when it came from --orch-id. WTR_ORCH_ID lets a caller pass it explicitly.
#
# FAILS CLOSED: with no orchestrator id in scope we cannot establish that identity,
# so only the exact ticket branch serves. The resolver then falls through to the
# registry / cwd-repo rungs, which resolve BY TICKET — the safe answer.
