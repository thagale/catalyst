// daemon-watchdog-run.mjs — CTL-1502 (Codex P1: "run the forwarder watchdog on
// monitor nodes"). A standalone host for startDaemonWatchdogProbe.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The watchdog is normally armed from startDaemon(), but
// `catalyst-stack` starts otel-forward on BOTH worker and monitor nodes while
// starting execution-core on worker nodes ONLY (a monitor node is observation
// substrate — broker + monitor + forward + event-mirror, no execution layer).
// A monitor node's forwarder was therefore supervised by pid-liveness alone and
// never got the stuck detection this ticket adds — precisely the gap the
// watchdog exists to close, on the nodes whose whole job is observation.
//
// Rather than start an execution layer on observation nodes (which would
// contradict the node-class design), this runs ONLY the probe: the same
// startDaemonWatchdogProbe, the same config resolution, the same targets.
// On a worker node the probe stays owned by the daemon, so exactly one process
// supervises the forwarder in either topology.
//
// Lifecycle: `catalyst-monitor watchdog-start|watchdog-stop|watchdog-status`
// supervises this with a pid file, mirroring the forward-* commands.

// Codex P1: resolve the Layer-1 config path the SAME way daemon.mjs does
// (CATALYST_CONFIG_FILE, else <cwd>/.catalyst/config.json). Calling
// readDaemonWatchdogConfig() with no path makes readDaemonWatchdogConfigLayer1
// return {} unconditionally, so every documented Layer-1 knob —
// `daemonWatchdog.mode: "enforce"` / `"off"` and all thresholds — would be
// silently ignored here. On a monitor node this is the ONLY watchdog host, so
// that would strand its forwarder shadow-only while workers honored the very
// same config file.
