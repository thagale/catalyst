// liveness-deflap.mjs — CTL-1091 Phase 2. Restore-side deflap (hysteresis) for
// the DISPATCH ownership roster.
//
// The shed side already has hysteresis: computeSurvivingRoster only drops a host
// after HEARTBEAT_GRACE_MS (~10 min ≈ 20 missed heartbeats). The restore side had
// none — a host that flaps back (laptop lid re-opens) would immediately re-enter
// the roster, grab its HRW slice, then strand it on the next lid-close. This
// module adds a symmetric restore hold: a host that transitioned dead→live must
// be observed continuously live for holdMs before it re-enters the dispatch
// roster. During the hold the surviving peer keeps covering the slice, so there
// is NO starvation gap — the recovering host merely defers RE-TAKING new work.
//
// Applies to the DISPATCH roster only (not recovery — see plan Phase 2 Overview):
// recovery keeps its grace-only surviving roster.
//
// Per-host observation state is a tiny `{ <host>: { liveSince: <ms>|null,
// everLive: <boolean> } }` map. `everLive` is monotonic-once-true and exists
// solely to distinguish "never checked in" from "went quiet"; admission does
// not read it. `__`-prefixed entries are metadata, never hosts.
// the caller persists (scheduler is the sole writer; monitor reads it read-only).

// A host present in `survivingRoster` (currently live) is admitted to the
// DISPATCH roster only once it has been continuously live for `holdMs`, tracked
// via a per-host `liveSince` timestamp. Semantics of `prevState[h]`:
//   • absent entry            → first observation / cold start. Treated as
//                               already past the hold (admit) so a cold start
//                               does NOT transiently shed every live host.
//   • { liveSince: <number> } → continuously live. Keep the timestamp; admit
//                               once nowMs - liveSince >= holdMs.
//   • { liveSince: null }     → was explicitly dead last tick → newly restored.
//                               Start the hold now (liveSince = nowMs); hold out
//                               until the window elapses.
// A host ABSENT from `survivingRoster` (shed/dead) resets its liveSince to null,
// so a later re-join restarts the whole hold (deflap).
//
// `self` is never held AND never shed — a host always owns its OWN work, even
// when it is absent from `survivingRoster` (a not-yet-heartbeated fresh start or
// a stale/laggy self-heartbeat read). The self guard is hoisted above the
// shed branch so it is reached regardless of self's observed liveness (CTL-1091
// correctness review #1).
//
// FAIL-SAFE: if the filter would empty the dispatch roster (e.g. a total liveness
// outage degraded survivingRoster to the full roster on a cold start where every
// host looks newly-restored), degrade to the surviving roster unchanged — deflap
// must never strand the whole board.
//
// Pure. Returns { dispatchRoster, nextState }; the caller persists nextState.
