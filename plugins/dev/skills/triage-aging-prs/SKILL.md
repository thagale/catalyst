# Triage Aging PRs

Drive a stale pull-request backlog to zero without breaking `main`.

The mistake this skill exists to prevent: **grinding through review comments PR by PR while
the real blocker is structural.** Fix the gate first, or you will do a night's work and merge
nothing.

## Step 0 — Inventory before you touch anything

Resolve the target repo and its **default branch** first — both are used throughout.
`$ARGUMENTS` carries `--repo owner/name`; nothing else reads it, so without this an
invocation naming another repo silently operates on the current checkout — and every
ruleset mutation and merge below would hit the wrong repository. Likewise a repo whose
default branch is `master`/`develop` must never be probed as `main`.

```bash
REPO="$(printf '%s' "${ARGUMENTS:-}" | sed -n 's/.*--repo[= ]\([^ ]*\).*/\1/p')"
REPO="${REPO:-$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)}"
BASE="$(gh repo view "$REPO" --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name)"   # never hardcode main
gh pr list --repo "$REPO" --limit 60 \
  --json number,title,isDraft,mergeStateStatus,isCrossRepository,createdAt,headRefName \
  --jq '.[]|[.number,(if .isCrossRepository then "FORK" else "base" end),.mergeStateStatus,
             (if .isDraft then "DRAFT" else "-" end),(.createdAt[0:10]),(.title|.[0:50])]|@tsv' |
  sort -k2,2 -k1,1n | column -t
```

Classify every PR before doing any work. Do NOT treat the raw open count as the goal:

| Class | What it means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Genuinely stale** | Opened well before the current work window | The actual target |
| **Fresh** | Opened in the last day or two | Steady-state flow, not backlog |
| **Draft** | `isDraft` | Not mergeable by design — exclude |
| **Do-not-land** | The user has said to leave it | Exclude, and re-check any bulk action against this set |
| **Release PR** | e.g. release-please's `chore: release main` | Outward-facing — the user's call, never auto-merge |

**Report the split.** "18 open" is meaningless; "3 genuinely stale, 12 opened today, 4 drafts" is
a status. A backlog whose count is flat while you merge steadily is not stuck — arrivals are
matching your throughput, which is a different problem with a different fix.

## Step 1 — Find the STRUCTURAL blocker first

Before any review work, ask: *can these PRs merge at all?*

### 1a. What does the branch actually require?

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/rules/branches/$BASE" --jq '.[]|"\(.type) (ruleset \(.ruleset_id))"'
# ONLY the rulesets this branch actually evaluates. A repo may also hold disabled
# rulesets, or ones targeting tags/other branches, whose rules never apply here —
# printing them identifies requirements that do not exist.
for id in $(gh api "repos/$REPO/rules/branches/$BASE" --jq '[.[].ruleset_id]|unique|.[]'); do
  gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$id" --jq '.rules[]|select(.type=="required_status_checks")|.parameters'
  gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$id" --jq '.rules[]|select(.type=="pull_request")|.parameters'
done
```

Two traps:
- **Rulesets vs classic protection.** `branches/main/protection` returning 404 "Branch not
  protected" does NOT mean unprotected — modern repos use **Rulesets** (Settings → Rules →
  Rulesets). Query `/rules/branches/$BASE`, which reports what actually applies.
- **Thread resolution hides inside `pull_request`.** `required_review_thread_resolution` is a
  *parameter* of the `pull_request` rule, not a rule type. Filtering by `.type` misses it and you
  will wrongly conclude threads don't block.

### 1b. Compare a fork PR's checks against a base PR's

```bash
gh pr view <BASE_PR> --repo "$REPO" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '[.statusCheckRollup[]?|(.name//.context)]|sort'
gh pr view <FORK_PR> --repo "$REPO" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '[.statusCheckRollup[]?|(.name//.context)]|sort'
```

**The fork gate.** GitHub withholds repository secrets from fork PR workflows (otherwise any
fork could exfiltrate them). So any check needing a credential — a deploy preview, a
cloud-provider integration — **never runs** on a fork. Its check is *absent*, not failing. If
such a check is `required`, every fork PR is permanently unmergeable no matter how clean.

Detect it by the check being **missing** from the fork's rollup while present on a base PR.

Remedies, in order of preference:
1. Give the contributor write access → future branches are in-repo and get the token.
2. Migrate existing heads to base-repo branches.
3. Temporarily remove **only the offending context** from `required_status_checks` —
   **ask the user first**, back the ruleset up, and record how to restore it:
   ```bash
   BLOCKER="Cloudflare Pages"   # the fork-incompatible check, whatever it is called here
   gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$ID" --jq '{name,target,enforcement,conditions,bypass_actors,rules}' > backup.json
   # Drop ONLY that context. Keep the rule, its other contexts, and the strict policy.
   jq --arg b "$BLOCKER" '
     .rules |= map(
       if .type == "required_status_checks"
       then .parameters.required_status_checks |= map(select(.context != $b))
       else . end)' backup.json > relaxed.json
   gh api -X PUT "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$ID" --input relaxed.json   # restore: --input backup.json
   ```
   **Do not delete the whole `required_status_checks` rule.** That is the tempting one-liner
   and it disables *every* other required check plus the strict/up-to-date policy — turning a
   targeted, reversible unblock into a repo-wide gate outage that is easy to forget to undo.
   Only when the blocker is genuinely the rule's *sole* context is removing the rule equivalent,
   and even then the surgical form above is what you want, because it stays correct if someone
   adds a second check later.

   Never `--admin`-merge instead; that bypasses the gate silently and per-PR.

**Know what else lives in that rule.** `strict_required_status_checks_policy` sits alongside the
contexts. Removing a single context leaves it intact (merges keep serializing); removing the whole
rule drops it too, which stops serialization — a large speedup and a real reduction in safety.
Whichever you do, state it.

### 1c. Is the automated reviewer actually firing?

A PR with **zero** review signal is not "reviewed and clean" — it is unreviewed.

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/<N>/reviews"  --jq '[.[]|select(.user.login|test("bot|codex|copilot";"i"))]|length'
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/<N>/comments" --jq '[.[]|select(.user.login|test("bot|codex|copilot";"i"))]|length'
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/<N>/reactions" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.squirrel-girl-preview+json" \
  --jq '[.[]|select(.user.login|test("bot|codex|copilot";"i"))|.content]'
```

Reviewer signals are **not all review objects** — check reviews, issue comments, AND reactions:
- **👍 (`+1`) on the PR description** = the no-findings **clean pass**.
- **👀 (`eyes`)** = acknowledged / in progress. **NOT a verdict — do not merge on it.**
- Review threads with severity badges = findings.

If a connector has been switched to request-only, nothing is reviewed until asked. Request
**once** per PR (`@codex review` or the repo's equivalent); do not re-request after each
remediation push — that is how a review↔fix treadmill starts.

### 1d. Is the base branch itself green?

```bash
gh run list --repo "$REPO" --branch "$BASE" --limit 8 --json conclusion,headSha --jq '.[]|"\(.headSha[0:8]) \(.conclusion)"'
```

If the base branch is red, every branch inherits it and you will misattribute failures to your own diff.
Fix or ticket that first, and record the failing test names so you can recognise them later.

## Step 2 — Triage every thread in parallel, and VERIFY

With many PRs, fan out one agent per PR (Task tool, or a workflow if available). Have each agent
**read the cited code on the PR's branch** and decide whether the defect is real — not summarize
the finding.

Require per thread: `threadId`, `severity`, `is_real`, `assessment` (citing what was read),
`fix_approach` (file + function + change), `complexity` (trivial/moderate/deep).

Insist on these, because they change the plan:
- **`is_real: false` happens.** Findings get fixed by a later commit on the branch, or describe an
  unreachable path. One in ten is typical. Fixing a non-defect wastes real time.
- **Whole PRs can be superseded.** If the fix already landed via another PR, the right action is
  to **close it with evidence**, not to fix it.
- Agents must be **read-only** here: no edits, commits, pushes, or thread replies. Triage and
  remediation are separate phases.

Then rank by `complexity`, and clear whole PRs rather than skimming the easy findings across many
— a PR is only mergeable when *every* thread is resolved.

## Step 3 — Fix, honoring the severity policy

- **P0/P1: always fix**, on every round.
- **P2 and below: use judgment on round one; defer on later rounds** to a follow-up ticket, reply
  with the link, and resolve the thread. Deferral *resolves* the thread — it does not leave it open.
- Match the severity string exactly. A regex whose fallback bucket is "P3" will silently
  mislabel a **P0** as low priority. Match P0 explicitly.

While fixing:
- **Verify the finding yourself.** Reviewers are often right and occasionally wrong; say so with
  evidence either way.
- **Prefer deleting the wrong thing over patching it.** If a change contradicts a documented
  invariant, removing it and fixing the root cause beats layering a guard.
- **Mutation-test any fix whose whole value is catching a failure.** Break the code and confirm
  the new test fails. A test that passes before *and* after your fix is not covering it.

## Step 4 — Conflicts need judgment, not a flag

Never blanket `--ours`/`--theirs`. The three real cases:

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Both sides added different items (imports, CI test lists, doc sections, test blocks) | **Union.** Dropping either side silently removes coverage. |
| One side duplicates something the other already has (a second `push:` key, a repeated block) | **Drop the duplicate** — keeping both can be invalid syntax. |
| Genuine semantic conflict | Read both, decide, and explain in the commit message. |

Always re-validate after resolving: `bash -n`, `node --check`, a YAML parse, and the file's own
test suite. A union that produces a duplicate YAML key breaks CI for everyone.

## Step 5 — Merge, and judge CI honestly

```bash
gh pr merge <N> --repo "$REPO" --squash --delete-branch
```

Before merging, check the **actual** failing checks rather than trusting the gate:

```bash
# Blocking = anything not a clean terminal success. FAILURE/ERROR alone is too narrow:
# TIMED_OUT / CANCELLED / ACTION_REQUIRED / STARTUP_FAILURE are terminal-bad, and an
# empty conclusion means still PENDING — none of which should be merged over silently.
gh pr view <N> --repo "$REPO" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '
  [ .statusCheckRollup[]?
    | {n:(.name//.context), c:(.conclusion//""), s:(.status//.state//"")}
    | select( (.c|IN("SUCCESS","NEUTRAL","SKIPPED")) | not )
    | "\(.n): \(if .c == "" then "PENDING("+.s+")" else .c end)" ]'
```

If something is red, decide deliberately:
- **Compare against the base branch.** The same failure on `$BASE` = pre-existing, not yours.
- **Re-run locally against the MERGE BASE, not a stash.** `git stash` only shelves *uncommitted*
  work — once your fix is committed and pushed, stashing changes nothing and the rerun still tests
  your head. A failure you introduced then reproduces with an identical count and gets mislabeled
  "pre-existing", which is the worst possible outcome since the skill then merges over it. Check
  out the base instead and compare:
  ```bash
  git stash list            # only meaningful if you have UNCOMMITTED work
  BASECOMMIT="$(git merge-base HEAD "origin/$BASE")"
  git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout -q "$BASECOMMIT"
  <run the failing suite>   # note the failing test NAMES, not just the count
  git checkout -q -         # back to your branch
  ```
  Compare **which tests fail**, not how many — two unrelated flakes can coincidentally match.
- **Re-run the job.** Different tests failing on a re-run of the same commit = flaky suite.
- Only then merge over it — and **say in your report that you did, and why**.

If strict/up-to-date is enforced, merges serialize: bring ONE PR up to date, let it merge, then
the next. Batch-advancing wastes build slots on heads that go stale before they finish.

**Use a real push, not the API's update-branch**, if the required check is a deploy integration —
an API-created merge commit may not trigger it, leaving the PR blocked on a check that never
appears.

## Step 6 — Reconcile the tickets

A merged PR usually means its ticket should advance. After a burndown, check every ticket
referenced by a merged PR and move any that are still open. See the repo's ticket-CLI skill for
the exact commands, and prefer the local replica for reads.

## Reporting

State the split, not the raw count: how many merged, how many *stale* remain, how many arrived
during the run. Name the structural blocker you found and whether it is fixed or worked around.
List anything you merged over a red check and why. If a ruleset is still relaxed, say so loudly
with the restore command — that is a security-relevant state you are leaving behind.
