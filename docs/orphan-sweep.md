# Periodic Orphan Sweep

`orphan-sweep.sh` is a launchd-scheduled bash script that runs every 30 minutes and reclaims
orphaned resources on unattended hosts. It complements the execution-core real-time reaper
(CTL-657) — it acts whether or not the orchestrator daemon is alive.

## What It Reclaims (Five Vectors)

| # | Vector | What | Safety gate |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Stale processes | Procs whose backing directory is gone. **Two branches, a UNION.** (a) *legacy*: `bun run`/`turbo`/`node` procs, path-unrestricted (it also reclaims debris in `/tmp`, `~/.codex/plugins/cache` and `<repo>/.claude/worktrees`). (b) *widened* (CTL-1531, `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN`): **any** command, but only under `$SWEEP_WT_ROOT` — the motivating case was four `sh -c "while :; do :; done"` loops that pegged ~4 cores for 16.5 h from a deleted worktree and that `pgrep -f 'bun run\|turbo\|node'` structurally could not see | Kill ONLY if the proc CWD is **definitely** gone (a `stat` errno of ENOENT — an unreadable cwd, e.g. EACCES/EIO/ESTALE, is UNKNOWN and spares); unknown CWD → skip. The widened branch adds: `ppid == 1` (re-read, not trusted from the snapshot), cwd segment-anchored under `$SWEEP_WT_ROOT`, an argv allowlist (fleet control plane), a command denylist (`tmux`/`screen`/`sshd`/… incl. the `progname:` setproctitle form), self/ancestor protection, an age floor, a per-run cap on **confirmed terminations** plus a `cap × 2` bound on delivered signals, a root-absent early bail, a TOCTOU re-check immediately before signalling that **re-probes the cwd** (never the cached one), and a post-signal exit confirmation (SIGTERM → wait → SIGKILL → wait) so only a process that actually exited is logged and emitted as reclaimed |
| 2 | Done-ticket worktrees | Worktrees for Linear "Done" tickets not cleaned by `/teardown` | `worktree-presweep.sh` stops sessions first; `git status --porcelain` must be clean; NEVER removes dirty worktrees |
| 3 | Stale phase signals | `status=running` signals whose `bg_job_id` is dead and >30 min old | Flip ONLY if `bg_job_id` absent from `claude agents --json`; never touch interactive-kind or terminal statuses |
| 4 | Trunk repo cache dirs | `~/.cache/trunk/repos` entries with mtime >30 days | mtime only; no live-process guard needed |
| 5 | Leaked agent-browser browsers | agent-browser's persistent daemon + its "Chrome for Testing" / `chrome-headless-shell` browser that outlived the CLI — reaped when a browser subtree is CPU-pegged (runaway) or older than a TTL, plus stale `~/.agent-browser/<session>.sock\|.pid` housekeeping (CTL-1500) | Every command under `/Applications/` is HARD-EXCLUDED so the personal `/Applications/Google Chrome.app` is NEVER touched. A browser with an agent-browser-SPECIFIC anchor (`~/.agent-browser/`, `agent-browser-chrome-`) is reaped on its own; a browser matched only by the SHARED Playwright markers (`ms-playwright/`, `playwright_chromiumdev_profile`) is reaped ONLY when a live agent-browser daemon (`…/node_modules/agent-browser/{bin,dist}/…`) owns it, so an unrelated Playwright job is never killed |

Telemetry: one `emit-otel-event.sh` call per reclaimed resource (`catalyst.sweep.reclaim`, vector `agent_browser` for #5), fail-open.

### Vector 5 tuning (agent-browser reaper)

Version-agnostic backstop for the CTL-1500 leak (old agent-browser builds have no
idle timeout). Knobs (env, all with production defaults):

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SWEEP_AB_ENABLED` | `1` | reaper on/off |
| `SWEEP_AB_CPU_THRESHOLD` | `30` | runaway browser %CPU threshold |
| `SWEEP_AB_MIN_AGE_SECS` | `600` | min browser age for the runaway rule (guards short automation bursts) |
| `SWEEP_AB_TTL_SECS` | `14400` | absolute leaked-browser age cap (4h) |
| `SWEEP_AB_SOCKET_DIR` | `$AGENT_BROWSER_SOCKET_DIR` → `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agent-browser` → `~/.agent-browser` | sock/pid dir |

Reap = graceful `kill` of the owning daemon (its `SIGTERM` handler closes the browser)
plus the root browser process (cascades helper children), then removal of that
session's `.sock`/`.pid`. A shared-Playwright-marker browser with no live agent-browser
daemon owner is left alone (it may be an unrelated Playwright job). Complements the
forward fix: phase workers now launch with `AGENT_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` set so newer
agent-browser self-shuts-down when idle.

## Installation

> **Golden rule (CTL-1306): install from the pristine clone, never a worktree.**
> The LaunchAgent bakes an absolute path to `orphan-sweep.sh` and that path is
> permanent. It MUST point at the main-only pristine clone `~/catalyst/plugin-source`
> (what `~/.catalyst/bin/*` and `catalyst.orchestration.pluginDirs` resolve to) —
> never an ephemeral checkout (a git worktree under `~/catalyst/wt/` or
> `.claude/worktrees/`, or a `/tmp` dir). A worktree path can be deleted, after
> which the job exit-127s silently every interval and debris piles up unnoticed —
> the original regression that killed the reaper on two of three hosts for ~10 days.

### 1. Install the launchd job

Normally the reaper is installed automatically as the 4th agent by
`catalyst-stack install-services` (which `catalyst-join.sh` runs during
onboarding), so a joined member gets it for free. To (re)install manually, run
the installer **from the pristine clone**:

```bash
bash ~/catalyst/plugin-source/plugins/dev/scripts/install-orphan-sweep.sh
launchctl list | grep orphan-sweep   # LastExit must be 0
```

`install-orphan-sweep.sh` is idempotent, prefers the registered `pluginDirs`
clone, and **refuses** to bake a linked-worktree or `/tmp` path. Preview with
`--print-only`; remove with `--uninstall`.

If `~/catalyst/plugin-source` is stale (e.g. a non-daemon host with no broker
auto-pull), fast-forward it first: `bash <repo>/plugins/dev/scripts/setup-plugin-source.sh`.

### 2. Verify a clean run

```bash
# Dry-run — logs intended actions without performing any
bash plugins/dev/scripts/orphan-sweep.sh --dry-run

# After an interval (or force a run)
tail -f ~/catalyst/orphan-sweep.log
```

### 3. Unload

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.coalesce.catalyst-orphan-sweep.plist
```

### Flipping the widened branch to enforce

Vector 1's widened (any-command) branch ships **dark** (`SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN=shadow`): it classifies
and logs every candidate as `[shadow] would kill …` and signals nothing. Bake it, read the log, size
the cap, then flip.

**Do not hand-edit the installed plist.** `install-orphan-sweep.sh` unconditionally regenerates and
replaces `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.coalesce.catalyst-orphan-sweep.plist`, and it runs as part of
every routine `catalyst-stack install-services` — a hand-edit is silently reverted by the next
install. The knob is therefore part of the shipped plist template and is resolved by the installer:

| # | Source | When to use it |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN` in the installing environment | the flip itself: `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN=enforce bash plugins/dev/scripts/install-orphan-sweep.sh` |
| 2 | `.catalyst/config.json` → `catalyst.sweep.procWiden` | a declared, committed intent for a repo/node |
| 3 | the value already in the installed plist | **preservation** — a previous flip survives a plain reinstall |
| 4 | `shadow` | the ADR-023 default |

So a plain `bash install-orphan-sweep.sh` on a host already at `enforce` keeps `enforce`, and a
host that has never been flipped stays at `shadow`. Anything outside `off|shadow|enforce` is
rejected with a warning and falls back to `shadow` — never to `enforce`.

Verify what is actually installed (this is the production value, not the in-script default):

```bash
grep -A2 SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.coalesce.catalyst-orphan-sweep.plist
```

To roll back, reinstall with `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN=off` (which removes the widened admission entirely)
or `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN=shadow` (which keeps observing).

The daemon-side sibling of this knob is `orchestration.orphanReaper.procReaper.widenMode`. The two
are **independent** — flipping one does not arm the other.

## Configuration (env overrides)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SWEEP_TRUNK_CACHE_DIR` | `$HOME/.cache/trunk/repos` | Vector 4 root |
| `SWEEP_WORKERS_GLOB_ROOT` | `$HOME/catalyst` | Vector 3 root (scans `*/workers/*/phase-*.json`) |
| `SWEEP_WT_ROOT` | `$HOME/catalyst/wt` | Vector 2 worktree root — and the hard boundary for vector 1's widened branch |
| `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN` | `shadow` | Vector 1 widened branch: `off` \| `shadow` \| `enforce`. **Dark by default** (ADR-023) — the flip to `enforce` is operator-owned. It is shipped in the LaunchAgent's `EnvironmentVariables` (see [Flipping the widened branch to enforce](#flipping-the-widened-branch-to-enforce)) so it survives reinstallation. An unrecognized value warns and falls back to `shadow`. |
| `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN_MAX_KILLS` | `5` | Per-run cap on **confirmed** widened terminations (`0` = uncapped), mirroring vector 2's `SWEEP_MAX_REMOVALS`. Enforcing path only, so `shadow` still reports every candidate. Overflow is logged and deferred. Delivered signals carry a second ceiling of `cap × 2` (each candidate is worth SIGTERM + SIGKILL), so a host where nothing responds to signals still stops rather than piling on. |
| `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN_MIN_AGE_SECS` | `900` | Minimum process age for a widened kill (matches `procReaper.minEtimeSec`). Unreadable age → skip. |
| `SWEEP_PROC_WIDEN_GRACE_SECS` | `5` | Seconds to wait for a **confirmed exit** after each of SIGTERM and SIGKILL before a widened reclamation is logged/emitted. `kill` reports delivery, not exit — and a probe that cannot answer is **unknown**, never an exit. |
| `SWEEP_PROC_CWD_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `5` | Deadline for the per-pid `lsof` cwd probe. `lsof` blocks in the kernel on a hung or stale mount, and this sweep runs from a LaunchAgent, so one such candidate would wedge the entire run and starve the vectors behind it. A timed-out probe yields an **unknown** cwd (which spares), never a truncated path. Implemented with a watchdog child, not `timeout(1)` — stock macOS ships neither `timeout` nor `gtimeout`. |
| `CATALYST_LSOF_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | The **daemon-side** sibling of the row above — the deadline `proc-reaper.mjs` puts on its own `lsof` cwd probe (single-pid and batched). Same rule: a timed-out probe yields an unknown cwd, which spares. Read at call time, so a test can drive a sub-second deadline; a value outside `(0, 600000]` falls back to `5000` (never to unbounded). Note the scope — the cwd **existence** probe (`statSync` / `stat`) is unbounded on both sides; see `DOCUMENTED_ASYMMETRIES` in `proc-reaper.test.mjs`. |
| `SWEEP_STALE_SECS` | `1800` | Staleness threshold for vector 3 |
| `SWEEP_CACHE_MTIME_DAYS` | `30` | Cache age threshold for vector 4 |
| `SWEEP_LINEAR_TEAMS` | `CTL ADV` | Teams to query for Done tickets (vector 2) |
| `SWEEP_DRY_RUN` | unset | Set to `1` or use `--dry-run` flag |
| `SWEEP_RUN_ID` | timestamp | Tags all telemetry for one run |

All widened numerics are parsed as **bounded base-10** integers. A value Bash arithmetic cannot evaluate — `08`/`09` (invalid octal) or anything past the signed range — falls back to the documented default **loudly**, rather than erroring at use time and silently leaving the sweep uncapped.

Test fixtures that share the widened process namespace use synthetic pids at or above 5,000,000.
That floor is above Linux's maximum pid and macOS's pid wrap, so synthetic rows cannot alias the
real self/ancestor rows deliberately injected by the test harness. The
`synthetic-pid-floor.test.sh` guard enforces this maintenance invariant without exemptions.

## Health check & troubleshooting

`catalyst-doctor` asserts the reaper is healthy (CTL-1306). Every reaper check is
a **WARN**, never a FAIL — the doctor's exit code gates the `catalyst-join`
activation gate, which runs *before* `install-services` would reinstall a stale
plist, so a FAILing reaper check would block a node from self-healing via join:
`reaper-installed` (WARN if the LaunchAgent is absent), `reaper-path` (WARN if the
baked program path no longer exists — the silent-death signature), `reaper-loaded`
(WARN if the plist is present but launchd never loaded the job), and
`reaper-health` (WARN on a `LastExit` of 127 or any other non-zero exit). A
loaded job with `LastExit` 0 (or that has never run yet) is `reaper-health` PASS.

- **`launchctl list | grep orphan-sweep` shows exit 127**, log full of
  `No such file or directory` → the baked path was deleted. Re-point from the
  pristine clone (Installation above). This is the CTL-1306 failure mode.
- **Debris not shrinking** → SAFE removals are capped per run
  (`maxRemovalsPerRun`, default 10). For a one-shot drain raise it:
  `SWEEP_MAX_REMOVALS=50 orphan-sweep.sh`. Remaining trees are protected
  SALVAGE/dirty — triage by hand, never `rm -rf` (that also leaves stale
  `.git/worktrees` admin entries; use `git worktree remove` + `git worktree prune`).

## Relationship to Other Components

- **CTL-657** (Done) — Fixed the real-time reaper in execution-core. The orphan sweep is a belt-and-suspenders complement that catches resources the reaper missed, or those that accumulate when the daemon is not running.
- **CTL-691** (Backlog) — Trunk daemon kill (`pkill trunk daemon launch`) is explicitly out of scope here.
- **CTL-692** (Research) — `claude agents` invocation timeout is explicitly out of scope here.
- **`/teardown`** skill — The preferred cleanup path for interactive sessions; the sweep handles the automatic-cleanup case for unattended hosts.

## Log

All output goes to `~/catalyst/orphan-sweep.log` (configured in the plist). Each line is prefixed with `[orphan-sweep <run-id>]` for correlation.
