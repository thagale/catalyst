// test-setup.mjs — bun [test].preload (loaded once before every *.test.mjs in
// this package). Makes the execution-core suite HERMETIC against Linear:
//
// The leak (proxy audit: 868 real Linear calls + real `issues update --status`
// WRITES from `bun test`) comes from FIVE default exec seams, one of which is a
// CHILD SHELL — linear-write.mjs → ../linear-transition.sh → bare `linearis`.
// An in-process JS mock cannot reach that bash process, so the guard MUST be at
// the env/PATH level: child processes inherit process.env (modified PATH + the
// deleted tokens) through spawnSync, so every `linearis`/`claude` invocation —
// JS spawnSync OR child shell — resolves to the fake binaries in __tests__/fake-bin
// and never touches the network.
//
// The SAME leak class exists for GitHub: production code shells `gh` (work-done
// probes, scheduler PR-merged adapter, scan-adapters, worktrees) so a test that
// reaches a default `gh` exec seam would flood the real GitHub API. The fake
// `gh` on PATH + the unset GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN close that the same way.
//
// Three layers, defence in depth:
//   1. PATH-shim: front PATH with fake `linearis`/`claude`/`gh` (records + benign JSON).
//   2. Token unset: even if a real binary is somehow reached, no creds → no write.
//   3. CATALYST_TEST flag: a tripwire other guards/tests can assert on.

// append to the REAL ~/catalyst/events/YYYY-MM.jsonl. 69% of the prod event
// log (194,544 lines) was CTL-9/bg-9 fixture pollution before this guard.
// Tests that want their own scratch still set CATALYST_DIR themselves; the
// common save/restore pattern now restores to this hermetic default instead
// of falling back to the real ~/catalyst. CATALYST_HERMETIC_DIR is the stable

// clean CI runner), is a genuine machine-local config with a real multi-host
// catalyst.cluster.staticRoster. A test that never overrides this env var then
// silently becomes "multi-host" and picks up real HRW ownership filtering in
// schedulerTick's ready.filter() — e.g. a ticket id that doesn't happen to hash
// to this host gets dropped from `ready` and a "dispatches new work" assertion
// fails, on this host only, for a reason that has nothing to do with the code
// under test. Point at a guaranteed-absent path so getLayer2ConfigPath() always
// resolves the "missing Layer-2 file" branch by default. Tests that want their
// own Layer-2 fixture still set CATALYST_LAYER2_CONFIG_FILE themselves; the
// existing save/restore pattern (save current value, delete/set for the test,
// restore in afterEach) already handles a pinned non-undefined default the same
