description: |
  Phase agent for the verify step of the 10-phase orchestrator pipeline (CTL-450).
  NEW skill — has no canonical wrapper. Runs read-only adversarial verification
  against the implement-phase diff: tsc, tests, lint, security scan, reward-hacking
  scan, code review, test coverage, silent-failure hunt. Writes
  ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/<TICKET>/verify.json then emits phase.verify.complete.<ticket>.
  Reads phase-implement.json as its prior-phase artifact. NEVER writes application
  code — only test files allowed. Spawned via phase-agent-dispatch via slash
  command — hence `user-invocable: true`.
user-invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: false  # invocable by model (Skill tool) AND user (slash command)

# phase-verify

You are the **verify phase agent**. You run inside `claude --bg` and own a single
responsibility: read-only adversarial verification of the implement phase's diff,
producing `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/<TICKET>/verify.json` with `regression_risk`,
`findings`, and `tests_attempted` fields. You then emit
`phase.verify.complete.<ticket>` and exit. Built on the [[_phase-agent-template]]
contract.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: NEVER write application code

You are a **read-only verifier**. The only files you may create or edit are:

- Test files (under `**/__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `test/**`, `tests/**`)
- The `verify.json` artifact in the worker directory
- Signal files via the standard emitter helper

Editing application code from this phase is a contract violation. If verification
surfaces a bug that requires code changes, you **record the finding** and let
[[phase-review]] (which IS allowed to write remediation commits) act on it.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: never hand-run a test's own git-fixture setup against your cwd

Your `cwd` is the ticket's real worktree, on the real branch you can push. Some tests
in this repo build their own throwaway git repo to exercise git-touching behavior
(e.g. a test that runs `git init` + `git config user.email/name` + `git commit` inside
an isolated `mkdtemp` sandbox). If you manually re-run that recipe yourself — to
reproduce or double-check something the test covers — **never point it at `.` or any
path under your own cwd.** Doing so configures a throwaway identity and wipes/commits
the real ticket branch, and it can reach the real remote (postmortem, 2026-07-30:
exactly this happened, and the resulting commit was pushed to a real GitHub branch
before a human caught it). If you need to hand-verify such a script,
build your own `mkdtemp` sandbox first and run every command with an explicit `cwd`
inside it — never in place.

## /goal

```
/goal "I have written ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/verify.json with the schema
       {regression_risk:int, findings:[...], tests_attempted:int, gates:{...}} AND
       I have NOT modified any application source files (only test files). I have
       printed the path on stdout."
```

## Work block

Run the same adversarial verification suite the current `oneshot` Phase 4 runs,
but record findings instead of attempting fixes.

### 1. Determine the base branch and diff

```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null \
  | grep "HEAD branch" | awk '{print $NF}')
BASE_BRANCH="${BASE_BRANCH:-main}"
DIFF_RANGE="origin/${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD"
```

#### CTL-608: empty-branch backstop

Defense-in-depth for the live `phase-implement` empty-branch gate. That gate runs
in the phase-implement End block, but the execution-core **reclaim-dead-work**
path emits `implement-complete` on a worker's behalf *without* running that End
block — so an empty branch (0 commits ahead) can still reach verify. Counting
commits-ahead here means an empty branch emits `phase.verify.failed` instead of
running the full gate suite and advancing an empty branch to `phase-pr`. Reuses
`BASE_BRANCH` from step 1; uses only POSIX/zsh-safe `git rev-list --count`.
Fail-open (warn + continue) when the base is unresolvable, matching
phase-implement and the mirror block's `_base branch unknown_` tolerance.
Uniquely-named fence so the e2e harness can extract+exercise it.

```bash phase-verify-empty-branch-gate
# CTL-608: backstop — an empty branch (0 commits ahead) means there is nothing
# to verify and advancing would open an empty PR. phase-implement's gate should
# already have caught this; this is defense-in-depth for the reclaim path.
# Fail-open if the base is unresolvable (warn + continue), matching phase-implement.
VERIFY_GATE_BASE=""
if git rev-parse --verify --quiet "origin/${BASE_BRANCH}" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  VERIFY_GATE_BASE="origin/${BASE_BRANCH}"
elif git rev-parse --verify --quiet "${BASE_BRANCH}" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  VERIFY_GATE_BASE="${BASE_BRANCH}"
fi
if [[ -n "${VERIFY_GATE_BASE}" ]]; then
  VERIFY_AHEAD="$(git rev-list --count "${VERIFY_GATE_BASE}..HEAD" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
  if [[ "${VERIFY_AHEAD:-0}" -le 0 ]]; then
    echo "phase-verify: 0 commits ahead of ${VERIFY_GATE_BASE}; empty branch, nothing to verify (CTL-608)" >&2
    "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/phase-agent-emit-complete" \
      --phase "$PHASE" --ticket "$TICKET" --status failed \
      --reason "empty_branch:0_commits_ahead_of_${VERIFY_GATE_BASE}"
    [[ -n "$COMMS" && -x "$COMMS" ]] && "$COMMS" send "$CHANNEL" \
      "phase-verify failed: empty branch (0 commits ahead of ${VERIFY_GATE_BASE})" \
      --as "$TICKET" --type attention --orch "$ORCH_ID" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "phase-verify: could not resolve integration base (no origin/${BASE_BRANCH} or ${BASE_BRANCH}); skipping empty-branch gate (CTL-608)" >&2
fi
```

### 2. Run read-only gates

Run each gate; record pass/fail/skip into the in-memory results map. Do not stop
on first failure — verification is exhaustive.

| Gate | Tool | Skill / agent |
|---|---|---|
| Type check | `tsc --noEmit` (or project's `typecheckCommand`) | [[validate-type-safety]] |
| Reward-hacking scan | grep-based pattern check | [[scan-reward-hacking]] |
| Unit tests | project test command | [[validate-type-safety]] |
| Lint | project lint command | [[validate-type-safety]] |
| Security review | dependency + secret scan | `/security-review` (built-in) |
| Code review | style/guideline adherence | [[pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer]] agent |
| Test coverage | per-file coverage on diff | [[pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer]] agent |
| Silent failures | unchecked try/catch + fallback hunting | [[pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter]] agent |

For each gate, run via `Bash` for the CLI ones and the `Task` tool for the agent
ones. Capture exit code + a one-line summary per gate.

#### Concurrency: cap parallel gate execution (memory safety)

Several gates shell out to the project's own test runner — Unit tests directly,
and the `pr-test-analyzer` agent indirectly (it re-runs the suite with coverage
instrumentation to compute diff coverage) — and each spawns a fresh test-runner
process that can hold multiple GB of RSS on its own. Batching several of these
as parallel tool calls in one turn compounds fast: 5+ concurrent test-spawning
gates observed piling up on one host pushed free memory below the OOM-guard
floor and got the whole verify phase killed before it produced a result, even
though the test suite itself was clean and fast when run alone.

- **Test-spawning gates run at most 2 concurrent.** Unit tests, Test coverage
  (`pr-test-analyzer`), Security review (if it shells out to a scanner), and
  Lint (if the project's linter is itself heavy) all count toward this cap. Do
  not batch more than 2 of these into one turn's parallel tool calls — start a
  third only after one of the first two returns.
- **Type check and the reward-hacking scan are exempt.** `tsc --noEmit` and the
  grep-based reward-hacking scan are sub-second and light (well under 500MB
  observed) — run them alongside anything else without counting against the cap.
- **Code review and silent-failure-hunter are read-only analysis agents** — they
  read and reason over the diff, they don't re-invoke the test runner. Run them
  concurrently with each other and with the lightweight gates, but not
  alongside a second test-spawning gate.

### 3. Compute `regression_risk` (0–10)

Aggregate signal:

| Signal | Risk delta |
|---|---|
| Any required CLI gate failed (tsc/test/lint/security) | +3 each |
| `scan-reward-hacking` flagged a HIGH-severity pattern | +3 |
| `code-reviewer` flagged a structural issue | +2 |
| `pr-test-analyzer` reports < 50% diff coverage | +2 |
| `silent-failure-hunter` flagged unchecked catch / fallback | +2 |
| Any agent surfaced a `must-fix` finding | +3 |

Clamp to `[0, 10]`. A regression_risk ≥ 5 means [[phase-review]] should create
remediation commits before the PR opens.

### 4. Optionally write **test-only** files

If `pr-test-analyzer` identifies an uncovered code path that has obvious tests, you
MAY add tests under `**/__tests__/` or `**/*.test.*`. Track each file added in the
`tests_attempted` count. **Do not edit application code under any circumstance**;
silent-failure-hunter's findings go into `findings`, never into a fix.

### 5. Write the artifact

```bash
ARTIFACT="${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/verify.json"
# Build $RESULTS_JSON in-memory and write atomically.
jq -nc \
  --argjson risk "$REGRESSION_RISK" \
  --argjson findings "$FINDINGS_JSON" \
  --argjson tests "$TESTS_ATTEMPTED" \
  --argjson gates "$GATES_JSON" \
  --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  '{regression_risk: $risk, findings: $findings, tests_attempted: $tests,
    gates: $gates, generatedAt: $ts}' > "${ARTIFACT}.tmp" \
  && mv "${ARTIFACT}.tmp" "$ARTIFACT"
```

**Findings array shape** — each entry:

```json
{
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "kind": "type|test|lint|security|review|coverage|silent-failure|reward-hacking",
  "file": "path/to/file.ts",
  "line": 42,
  "message": "Short human-readable description",
  "recommendation": "What phase-review should do about this"
}
```

**Gates object shape** — keyed by gate name:

```json
{
  "typecheck": { "status": "pass|fail|skip", "exitCode": 0, "summary": "..." },
  "tests":     { "status": "pass", "exitCode": 0, "summary": "..." }
}
```

### Inbox check (CTL-749)

After all gates have run, check for mid-flight context updates from the human:

1. If `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl` exists and is non-empty, read it fully.
2. Parse each JSONL line — entries have `kind: "comment"` or `kind: "description_changed"`.
3. For each entry, decide:
   - **Absorb and continue**: the update is additive context (clarification, extra constraints,
     "also handle X") — fold it into your working context and continue. Post a brief reply comment
     acknowledging the update (one sentence).
   - **Pause and replan**: the update fundamentally changes scope or invalidates the current
     approach — emit `failed` with `reason: "mid_flight_replan_needed"` via
     `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/phase-agent-emit-complete` and post the reason to Linear as a
     comment before exiting.
4. After reading, archive processed entries:
   ```bash
   [[ -f "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl" ]] && \
     mv "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.jsonl" \
        "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/inbox.processed-$(date +%s).jsonl" || true
   ```
5. If no inbox file or it is empty, continue normally.

## End block

```bash
TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
TMP="${SIGNAL_FILE}.tmp.$$"
jq --arg ts "$TS" --arg artifact "$ARTIFACT" \
  '.updatedAt = $ts | .artifact = $artifact' \
  "$SIGNAL_FILE" > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" "$SIGNAL_FILE"
```

Mirror the phase output to Linear as a single comment (CTL-632). Renders
regression risk, per-gate pass/fail/skip, findings-by-severity, and the
full findings JSON inside a `<details>` block. Body is hard-truncated to
30,000 bytes (well under Linear's effective comment cap) with a marker.
Fail-open and idempotent via the per-phase marker file.

## Capture friction (compound loop, CTL-789)

Before emitting completion, record this phase's friction to the shared per-ticket
friction log. This is the **producer** half of the compound-engineering loop:
[[ticket-compound]] later harvests `thoughts/shared/friction/${TICKET}.md` to
distill durable learnings. `${TICKET}` is already resolved in the Prelude — do
not re-derive it.

Replace each `<…>` placeholder below with your **real** experience verifying this
ticket — 3–6 lines total, terse. `"None."` is a valid value for any bullet when
the phase was frictionless. The record header
(`## <phase> · <TICKET> · <ISO-8601 timestamp>`) is a cross-phase contract shared
by all five phase skills — keep it byte-identical; only the phase label differs.

This append is **best-effort and off the critical path**: it must NEVER fail the
phase or block the emit-complete below.

```bash
# --- Compound-engineering friction capture (CTL-789, Slice 1). Off critical path; NEVER block emit. ---
FRICTION_LOG="thoughts/shared/friction/${TICKET}.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FRICTION_LOG")"
[ -f "$FRICTION_LOG" ] || printf '# Friction log — %s\n' "${TICKET}" > "$FRICTION_LOG"
cat >> "$FRICTION_LOG" <<EOF

## verify · ${TICKET} · $(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z)
- **Backtracks / redone work:** <where you backtracked or redid work this phase — or "None.">
- **Missing / wrong / hard-to-find context:** <context that was absent, stale, or hard to locate — or "None.">
- **If I'd known:** <the ADR / guidance / past learning that would have saved this — the compounding signal — or "None.">
EOF
```

```bash
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/phase-agent-emit-complete" \
  --phase "$PHASE" --ticket "$TICKET" --status complete

# Self-halt after complete to prevent zombie workers (CTL-778 step 2).
# Read our own bg_job_id from the signal file and ask Claude to stop us.
# Best-effort: a failed stop is covered by the daemon reaper backstop.
if [[ -n "${ORCH_DIR:-}" && -f "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/phase-${PHASE}.json" ]]; then
  _SELF_BG=$(jq -r '.bg_job_id // empty' \
    "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/phase-${PHASE}.json" 2>/dev/null || true)
  [[ -n "$_SELF_BG" ]] && claude stop "${_SELF_BG:0:8}" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi

[[ -n "$COMMS" ]] && "$COMMS" done "$CHANNEL" --as "$TICKET" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

## Failure handling

A failure here means verification itself broke (e.g., a gate process crashed),
not that a gate failed — gate failures are recorded into `findings` and the phase
still emits `complete`.

```bash
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/phase-agent-emit-complete" \
  --phase "$PHASE" --ticket "$TICKET" --status failed \
  --reason "<short reason>"
[[ -n "$COMMS" ]] && "$COMMS" send "$CHANNEL" \
  "phase-verify failed: <reason>" --as "$TICKET" --type attention \
  --orch "$ORCH_ID" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
exit 1
```

## Why this is a separate skill from validate-plan

[[validate-plan]] checks that a plan was executed against a known plan document.
phase-verify is adversarial — it doesn't read the plan; it reads the diff and
hunts for regressions. The orchestrator's pipeline may run both (validate-plan
inside implement, then verify on the resulting branch).
