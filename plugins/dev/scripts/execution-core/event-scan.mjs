// event-scan.mjs — CTL-587 historical scan of execution-core's events.jsonl,
// reworked for bounded memory in CTL-673.
//
// Three count queries no existing consumer provides:
//   - countReviveEvents({ticket, orchId, since, path}) — the per-ticket revive
//     budget for recovery.mjs.
//   - countRemediateCycles({ticket, orchId, since, path}) — the event-counted
//     verify⇄remediate budget (CTL-653).
//   - countDistinctRevivingTickets({windowMs, now, path}) — the storm-breaker
//     that prevents a chain reaction when many tickets revive at once.
//
// CTL-673: the daemon calls these on its hot path — once per in-flight ticket
// and once per reclaim-eligible signal, on every event-log write. The old
// implementation `readFileSync`'d the WHOLE monthly log (~183 MB / ~297K lines)
// per call, allocating a fresh giant string + array each time; observed daemon
// RSS hit 1.8 GB after ~5h (JavaScriptCore never returns the freed pages).
//
// We now keep a per-path incremental index: a byte cursor advanced with the
// shared `scanEventsChunked` primitive (event-tail.mjs), retaining ONLY the two
// event families these counters query (`phase.implement.revive.*` and
// `phase.remediate.complete.*`) as compact records. Repeated calls against the
// same path read only newly-appended bytes; each query filters the small
// retained list. Per-wake work becomes O(appended bytes); steady-state RSS is
// bounded by the chunk size + the retained relevant-event list. The returned
// numbers stay byte-identical to the old whole-file scan (existing tests guard
// this). The only behavioral change is *when* bytes are read.
//
// Parse failures on a line are skipped silently (via parseEventTailChunk). A
// missing log yields 0 from all three functions — the cold-start path the
// daemon hits before the first event lands. The index is process-lifetime
// in-memory state: a daemon restart re-seeds from offset 0 on the first call
// (one bounded streaming pass), which is correct because the counters need full
// history. Monthly rotation changes getEventLogPath() → a fresh index entry.
