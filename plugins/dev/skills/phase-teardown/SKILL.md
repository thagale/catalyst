name: phase-teardown
description: Phase agent for the 10th/terminal step of the pipeline (CTL-703). Performs all terminal wrap-up after monitor-deploy — verifies the PR merged, posts a final Linear comment with per-phase timings, transitions Linear to Done (the sole Done writer now), archives the worker dir to ~/catalyst/archives/<TICKET>/, removes the local worktree + branch, then emits phase.teardown.complete.<TICKET>. Reads phase-monitor-deploy.json as its prior-phase artifact. Dispatched via phase-agent-dispatch as a slash command — user-invocable: true.

# phase-teardown

Terminal phase of the Catalyst pipeline (CTL-703). Runs after `phase-monitor-deploy`
has confirmed the deployed canary. Performs all end-of-lifecycle housekeeping:
safety-gates on merge status, posts a per-phase timing summary to Linear, transitions
the ticket to Done, archives the worker dir, and removes the local worktree + branch.

## Inputs

Environment:
- `TICKET` — Linear identifier (e.g. `CTL-703`). Required.
- `ORCH_DIR` — orchestrator working directory; signal files live under
  `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/`.  Defaults to `$CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR`.
- `ORCH_ID` — orchestrator instance ID. Defaults to `$CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID`.
- `PLUGIN_ROOT` — resolved from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` or the skill's own dir tree.

Signal files read (all under `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET}/`):
- `phase-monitor-deploy.json` — required prior-artifact; missing → fail.
- `phase-monitor-merge.json` — required for safety gate (`.pr.mergedAt` / `.pr.ciStatus`).
- `phase-*.json` — all present signal files are read for per-phase timing table.

## /goal condition

```
/goal "The pipeline for ${TICKET} has been fully wrapped-up: the PR is confirmed
       merged, a per-phase timing summary has been posted to Linear, Linear is
       transitioned to Done, the worker dir is archived to ~/catalyst/archives/${TICKET}/,
       the local worktree and branch are removed, and phase.teardown.complete.${TICKET}
       has been emitted to the event log."
```

## Done-judgment — verify the ticket is GENUINELY done before you tear down (CTL-1157)

You are a phase agent that CAN reason, and teardown is the LAST gate before the
ticket is marked Done and its worktree destroyed. **Before you write Done, verify
the ticket is genuinely done — do NOT trust "monitor-merge merged a PR" as proof
the whole ticket is complete.** A ticket commonly has more than one PR (a second
PR, a human PR opened outside the pipeline, an abandoned spike); monitor-merge
tracked only the pipeline's OWN PR. Marking Done while another PR that is part of
the solution is still open is the silent-rot failure CTL-1157 exists to prevent.

This is the same open-PR remediation rubric the recovery-pass delegate uses —
applied here as **"teardown verifies it's done."** It complements (does not
replace) the merge safety-gate above.

**STEP 1 — Enumerate the ticket's OPEN PRs (the facts).** The fence below runs the
CTL-1157 open-PR ENUMERATOR (`open-pr-gate.mjs` — the single source of truth that
UNIONs the ticket-key search + the branch-head pass + the Linear-attachment pass,
confirming OPEN via `gh`) and prints any still-open PRs. It is a FACTS source, not
a block: it never aborts teardown on its own (alarm-not-block). YOU read its output.

**STEP 1½ — If the check came back UNVERIFIABLE, do NOT treat it as clean.** The
enumerator returns `unverifiable:true` (with a reason) when the authoritative GitHub
check could not be completed — the ticket's repo could not be derived, a `gh`
list/view failed, or an attachment-linked PR could not be viewed. The fence surfaces
that state explicitly ("open-PR verification was UNVERIFIABLE … (reason)") instead of
collapsing it to an empty list. **UNVERIFIABLE ≠ CLEAN.** An unverifiable check is
NOT "no open PR remains" — do not mark Done and remove the worktree on it. Finish the
verification (re-run the enumerator, or eyeball the ticket's PRs by hand) and, if you
still cannot confirm the board is clean, fail-out per STEP 2's genuine-judgment path
(emit `phase.teardown.failed.${TICKET}` with the reason) so the unverified teardown
surfaces rather than proceeding silently.

**STEP 2 — Reason about EACH open PR and remediate it yourself.** For every PR the
enumerator printed:

- **Still needed / part of the solution** → FINISH it (rebase onto base, fix CI,
  merge it) before you proceed. Do NOT tear down with deliverable work unmerged.
- **Abandoned / superseded** (a later PR replaced it, a dead spike, a duplicate) →
  CLOSE it yourself: `gh pr close <n> -R <owner/repo> --comment "<why — superseded by
  #X / abandoned / duplicate of #Y>"`. Closing a dead PR is autonomous, not an escalation.
- **Cross-repo PRs (CTL-1157):** when the enumerator printed a PR as `owner/repo#n`
  (a cross-repo Linear attachment — a DIFFERENT repo than this ticket's), you MUST
  target that repo explicitly on BOTH paths — `gh pr merge <n> -R <owner/repo> …` and
  `gh pr close <n> -R <owner/repo> …`. A bare `gh pr merge/close <n>` runs against the
  ticket's repo and would merge/close the wrong same-numbered PR while leaving the
  attached `owner/repo#n` open (this matches the fence's own `-R` warning above).
- **Genuine judgment call** (the open PR conflicts with an ADR/principle, or you
  cannot safely decide needed-vs-abandoned) → do NOT mark Done; emit
  `phase.teardown.failed.${TICKET}` via the failure template with a concrete reason
  so the stuck PR surfaces (the scheduler/recovery layer then escalates it). This
  is the rare case — mechanically-resolvable PRs you finish/close yourself.

**STEP 3 — Only once no open PR remains that SHOULD remain**, continue to the Linear
Done transition below and tear down. A clean teardown (every open PR finished or
closed) leaves the backstops silent; tearing down with an open PR still present
fires the loud `recovery.done-applied-with-open-pr` alarm — which is exactly the
signal that you skipped this verification.
