### Skills-Dir Plugin Loading & Reliability Fixes

Plugins now load exclusively from a live `~/catalyst/plugin-source` checkout via `~/.claude/skills/` symlinks, retiring the version-keyed marketplace cache that caused merged changes to stay invisible until the next release bump. This release also fixes the otel-forward DLQ amplification loop (terminal 4xx errors now drop cleanly instead of cycling), ensures worktree salvage snapshots unpushed commits before any destructive removal, and makes escalation comment + `needs-human` label an atomic operation so tickets actually appear in the inbox. Run `setup-plugin-source.sh` on any fleet node not yet cut over — until then, `doctor` will report a worker-FAIL on `skills-dir-plugins`.

### Escalation Durability & Premature Done Guards

Escalations now survive GC via a durable per-ticket store, so Needs-You cards no longer vanish when a ticket goes terminal. Three independent guards close the false-Done/false-advance family: a dispatch freshness gate, a live GitHub merged check in teardown, and a PR-merged gate in the scheduler's terminal Done writer. Worker nodes can also now set `CATALYST_DRAIN_DISABLED=1` to permanently ignore drain requests, emitting a `node.drain.ignored` tripwire event instead of silently halting new-work admission.

### Escalation Visibility & Stalled-PR Detection

The unstuck sweep now actually reaches the operator: stalled tickets get a `needs-human` label and a Linear comment instead of silently logging an event that nobody sees. A new periodic timer probes in-flight PRs for CI failures, review latency, and no-push signals, writing stall stamps that board-health reads to emit nudges — enable it with `orchestration.stalledPrSweep.enabled` in your config. This release also closes two fleet-wide triage bugs where host-local dispatch caps let ownership churn multiply real spawns across nodes, and the orch-monitor sidebar nav is restored for mobile viewports.

### Stranded Ticket Recovery & Monitoring Node Substrate

The board-health delegate now detects mid-pipeline tickets that have gone dark — no worker, no live job, no recent recovery intent — and routes each one to the appropriate revival path (open PR remediation, remote branch resume, or fresh restart). Separately, monitor and developer nodes now run a proper event-mirror substrate instead of the execution core, so observation-only machines no longer accidentally join the dispatch roster; `catalyst doctor` and `verify-node` both surface a dead mirror as a real failure rather than silently passing. Several correctness fixes ship alongside: stranded-ticket evidence was previously never populated due to a map key mismatch, recovery-pass reclaim was silently failing on non-FSM phases, and queued/blocked labels now clear reliably once a ticket starts running.

### Account Health Visibility & Worktree Resume

The orch-monitor now surfaces Claude account health everywhere you look: a new accounts-probe library (TTL-cached, edge-triggered) backs a `GET /api/accounts` endpoint and `/api/accounts/stream` SSE feed, with a live strip in the Ink HUD and a banner in the web dashboard that fires loudly when an account degrades. Worktree creation now seeds from `origin/<ticket>` when that remote branch exists, so a resumed or reclaimed worktree picks up where the previous worker left off instead of silently orphaning pushed commits. Board-scan events also now carry per-host slot counts (`recovery.slot.capacity`, `recovery.slot.in_use`, `recovery.slot.free`) as chartable Loki attributes, making fleet-wide free-capacity queries like `sum(recovery.slot.free)` possible for the first time.

### Claude Account Switching Command

The new `catalyst-stack claude-account` command handles the full Claude SDK account rotation workflow in one step: `status` shows per-account utilization and reset times, `switch <handle>` validates the target, flips the SOPS secret, commits, pushes, and verifies the new account is active and error-free. A `sync` subcommand lets a second node adopt a pushed switch without repeating the full procedure. The release also fixes the orchestration monitor surfacing "unknown reason" for stalled tickets that actually had a specific `attentionReason` like `sdk-overloaded-exhausted`, and patches a broker bug where pre-workspace `node_modules` debris could shadow root installs and leave daemons running stale dependency versions.

### Deployment Mode Resolver & Credential Hardening

This release introduces a unified deployment-mode resolver (`single-host`, `cluster`, or `cloud`) that reads identically in bash and JS, with advisory doctor checks and gated tunnel/webhook behavior wired across execution-core, orch-monitor, and `catalyst-join.sh`. It also fixes a live credential outage: daemon processes now re-arm their GitHub token from disk on every cluster-sync tick rather than inheriting a frozen env at boot, and `linear-reconcile-cli` correctly falls back to `LINEAR_API_KEY` when `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` is absent. Several reliability fixes round out the release: stale `needs-human`/`blocked` labels can no longer be re-applied to tickets already terminal in Linear, escalated recovery intents no longer latch permanently past their 7-day TTL, and the board no longer shows zero tickets for teams registered only in `cluster.json`.

### Worktree Guard & DNS Rebinding Fix

The monitor's reply endpoint now validates `Origin` against a trusted allowlist of loopback addresses, local hostnames, and non-loopback IPs — closing a DNS rebinding hole where an attacker-controlled page could post Linear comments as the operator. Separately, every shell-side `git worktree remove --force` call now runs a safety check that refuses removal if your current directory is inside the target or any process holds an open handle under it, protecting against accidental self-deletion that the Node reaper never covered.

### Slot Deck Fixes & Direnv Profile Sync

The slot deck now correctly shows which slots are occupied — SDK/executor workers are visible to the deck, held tickets are separated into a "Held — awaiting you" section rather than ranked as imminent dispatches, and header counts derive from the deck's own boxes so the two can never contradict each other. Triage admission is now level-triggered, meaning tickets already sitting in Triage when a worker dir vanishes get picked up on the next sweep instead of stranded. `cluster-sync` also gains a new `syncProfileFiles` step that materializes direnv profiles from a SOPS bundle, so worker repos get the right environment variables on every host without hand-provisioning files.

### Inbox Conversation Surface & Linear API Burn Fixes

The inbox is now a full conversation surface: you can read a parked ticket's ask summary, thread, and suggested replies — and post a response as yourself without leaving the inbox. Alongside this, a cluster of Linear API quota fixes lands together: the Workers page now reads peer liveness and capacity from Loki instead of a stale Linear anchor, the broker authenticates as the app actor so reconcile reads no longer bill your personal API bucket, and several scheduler paths that were firing live Linear probes on every tick now use the replica or a cooldown window instead.

### Needs-Human Clears on Reply

When a developer responds to a parked ticket, it now immediately drops off the "Needs you" list — no matter whether the worker directory still exists. Previously, most parked tickets were permanently stuck in that state because the clear was gated on a local directory that gets cleaned up after a worker is reaped.

### Supervised Watchers, Orphan Reaper & Board Health

Channel-watchers now run as supervised launchd daemons that emit a heartbeat every interval and trigger a broker dead-man's switch alert when a watcher goes silent for more than three intervals. The orphan reaper drops its node/bun/turbo allowlist and now reaps any process whose cwd sits under a deleted worktree, batching the cwd lookups into a single `lsof` call to keep sweep cost under 730 ms. Two new board-health checks round out the release: one flags in-flight tickets with no worker, no signal file, and no open PR, and one bounds every read of the monthly event log to a time-covering tail — cutting a 341 MB scan from 1,114 MB peak RSS to 143 MB flat.

### Dual-Harness Migration & Event Loop Fix

Run `migrate-dual-harness.sh` to migrate a single-harness repo (Claude-only or Codex-only) to the vendor-neutral dual-harness layout where both Claude Code and Codex share the same instructions and skills — checkup §10 and a new foundry skill handle the split automatically. A daemon event loop stall that caused 72–97 second heartbeat gaps during worktree cleanup bursts is also resolved, along with a fix that stamps provider delivery IDs onto webhook envelopes so the smee-vs-cloud parity harness can actually join on them.

### Daemon Stability & Memory Audit Remediation

This release fixes a cluster of runtime reliability issues discovered during a live memory and health audit on production nodes. The most impactful changes stop a 115-second scheduler stall caused by reading a 300 MB event log on every tick (now a bounded cursor scan), close a file-descriptor leak in the delegate-runner that was trending toward EMFILE, and silence ~300 spurious "daemon degraded" phone notifications per day by replacing a naked edge trigger in the notification filter with a 180-second sustained-state hold. Also included: per-process RSS/heap OTel gauges on every daemon so future leaks can be attributed to a specific service, edge-triggered fleet-health probes that fire once per degradation episode instead of on every tick, and a health-responder backstop that now supervises the host-metrics sampler so a silently dead agent gets auto-kickstarted rather than going unnoticed for days.

### Cloud-Sync Self-Heal & Daemon Health Responder

Two fixes targeting the root causes of the 2026-07-23 replica-writer outage. The cloud-sync writer now exits cleanly within a bounded timeout on both stall and shutdown paths, writes a breadcrumb when it self-heals, and detects half-open sockets in roughly 2 ticks instead of 80+ minutes using SDK `lastFrameAt`. A new stateless launchd sweep runs every 3 minutes to catch the case where the writer dies and launchd fails to respawn it — kicking it back with a bounded, escalating retry rather than depending on `KeepAlive` alone. After merging, run `catalyst-stack install-services` on affected nodes and verify with `catalyst doctor`.

### Agent Browser Leak Fix & Scheduler Hardening

Leaked agent-browser Chrome processes that outlived their worker sessions — sometimes pegging a CPU core indefinitely — are now reaped automatically by a new vector in the hourly orphan sweep, which targets runaway or idle Chrome-for-Testing instances while leaving personal Chrome untouched. Workers also receive an idle-timeout environment variable at dispatch so agent-browser shuts itself down after 5 minutes of inactivity on supported versions. Two scheduler fixes round out the release: phantom ticket directories (like `.catalyst`) no longer poison board-health checks, and a transient source conflict during dispatch-time rebase now triggers a single retry against a fresh base before parking the ticket as needs-human.

### Autonomous PR Block Recovery

When a PR fails to merge, the recovery pass now probes GitHub live — checking CI status, unresolved bot review threads, and review decisions — and routes autonomously: bounded fixes get dispatched to a worker, while genuine human gates (CHANGES_REQUESTED from a person, no open PR found) escalate with specific context instead of an opaque failure message. A `CATALYST_EXECUTOR_BY_PHASE` JSON env var also lands in this release, letting you set durable per-phase executor routing in `execution-core.env` without it being wiped by the broker's periodic `git reset`. The recovery pass feature ships behind `CATALYST_RECOVERY_PASS=shadow|enforce` and is off by default.

### Dispatch Roster Failover & Worktree Repair

Offline and never-live hosts no longer strand their share of the ticket backlog — dispatch ownership now hashes over a liveness-filtered roster with restore-side deflap hysteresis, so a live host picks up any slice whose owner has gone dark. A separate fix repairs worktrees whose `thoughts/shared` was left as a plain directory instead of a symlink, so handoffs and research written into reused worktrees actually sync instead of silently accumulating in a dead-end local dir.

### Agent House-Rules Auto-Seeding & Inbox Polish

Any repo you enroll in Catalyst now automatically receives the "Working the Loop" agent house-rules block — seeded into AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md if that's what the repo uses) without any manual setup. The block itself has been hardened: Linear reads must go through the `catalyst-dev:linearis` skill rather than raw API calls or hand-rolled sqlite, and a contradictory degraded escape that could reintroduce shared-quota burn has been removed. Inbox rows also get a cleaner look — favicon restored, unwrapped ID, two-line title, and corrected pane accent.

### Agent House Rules & Replica Read Fix

Two changes land together to make unattended agents less error-prone. A new "Working the Loop" block is now seeded into every project's `AGENTS.md` via `agents-house-rules.md`, teaching agents to subscribe to the unified event log instead of polling GitHub or CI, detect automated review approvals via reactions, and read Linear tickets from the local replica rather than the live API. Alongside that, the replica-read instruction itself is corrected — background agents were silently falling through to bare `linearis` because `linear_read_ticket` is a shell function that never resolves in an unattended Bash session; the instruction now leads with the `sqlite3` form that works in any shell.

### Replica-Read Detector Fixed

The Linear replica-read detector introduced in a prior release was never actually firing, leaving agents free to burn the shared API quota on reads the replica could have served. The fix rewrites the command-word matching from a single anchored regex to a token walk that correctly resolves the real command past environment assignments, wrapper prefixes like `direnv exec .`, and shell keywords — and now recognizes both `linear` and `linearis`. The enforce mode remedy path is also corrected to an absolute location so it's actually sourceable in the repos where the hook now fires.

### Codex Executor & Worker Label Ownership

The daemon can now dispatch phase workers to OpenAI Codex via a new `codex-exec` executor adapter, routed per-phase through `executorByPhase` config with zero behavior change until you explicitly flip a phase to it. Linear boards now show which node owns each in-flight ticket via stamped `worker:<host>` labels — ownership is board-filterable and readable from the local replica without a live Linear call. Both worker-label provisioning paths (`reconcile_worker_host_labels` and `reconcile_worker_status_labels`) are hardened against the current Linear API's `isGroup:true` requirement, which broke fresh-workspace installs; run the setup script on any new node to provision labels cleanly.

### Thenable-Aware Removal Confirmation

The `removeLabel` async bug is fixed — previously, inspecting a Promise's `.removed` property always returned `undefined`, so failed removals were silently treated as successful.

### Two-Axis Worker State Model

Worker state transitions now fan out through a single `recordTransition` chokepoint that writes to all five sinks — Linear Status, worker-status label, event log, OTLP, and broker table — on every confirmed state change, with per-sink fail-open isolation so one unavailable sink can't block the others. A new `convergeDispositionLabel` function enforces full disposition precedence (`needs-human > needs-input > blocked > queued`), and the `worker-status` Linear label group is provisioned automatically by `setup-execution-core-states.sh`. The HUD queue UI now reflects the corrected disposition buckets, and `waiting` has been renamed to `queued` throughout.

### Liveness Off Linear

Cross-host dead-host detection now reads from Loki instead of Linear, eliminating the ~120 heartbeat writes per hour that were tripping the rate-limit breaker. Two live-deploy bugs in the initial reader were caught and fixed: stale streams no longer win the newest-host race, and in-flight ticket enrichment now runs as a separate fail-open query. The switch is gated behind `CATALYST_LIVENESS_READ_SOURCE=loki` — set it on all hosts simultaneously to enable; unset to revert instantly.

### Recovery Loop Elimination & Escalation Fixes

This release closes five compounding loops that caused the recovery pass to silently discard verdicts, re-triage tickets indefinitely, and emit no-progress escalations forever. Recovery-pass sessions now persist a single verdict (`fixed`, `leave-alone`, or `escalate`) to the event log, ledger, and Linear in every case — and exhausted intents surface loudly as needs-human with a rendered brief instead of latching silently. Infinite escalation loops are capped and go terminal, triage re-dispatches are bounded per ticket, and the boot-resume approval gate finally has a CLI (`boot-resume-approve.mjs --list` / `<ticket>`) so gated recovery passes can actually be unblocked.

### Linear Read Observability & Actuation Liveness

Every Linear read now emits a `catalyst.linear.read` event with `source` and `result` attributes, so your OTEL collector can derive read totals and a staleness histogram — and alert on replica bypasses before the 429 breaker trips. The delegate's board-scan events now record whether a proposed move was actually dispatched, and a new `checkActuationLiveness` invariant flags sustained propose-but-never-dispatch conditions automatically. A negative cache on terminal-probe and census reads stops replica-miss tickets from firing live Linear reads every tick, which was the primary driver of breaker flaps.

### Linear Breaker Observability & Board Health Actuation

The Linear circuit breaker now records why it opened (rate-limit 429 vs. timeout) and which caller triggered it, making the 12–22 daily trips on mini attributable and falsifiable from logs for the first time. On the board-health side, deferred recovery intents now have a live consumer so they actually dispatch instead of rotting, operator-sanctioned needs-human latches are suppressed from re-proposal so genuinely stuck tickets surface, and stale escalated recovery intents expire after 7 days instead of pinning tickets in needs-human forever. The top measured breaker driver — eligible empty-reconfirm firing a live Linear read every quiet tick — is also removed entirely; a replica-empty is now trusted directly with zero live Linear reads.

### Durable Fence Event Log & Done Path Fix

The fence write path now appends durable `fence.claimed`/`fence.released` events to the canonical event log instead of relying solely on Linear, eliminating the risk of fence emits triggering the admission freeze. A bug in `fenceGuard` that caused it to compare the wrong generation counter — blocking every ticket from reaching `Done` automatically on multi-host rosters — is now fixed by reading the correct cross-host claim generation from `cluster-generation.json`. Pino log levels are also now mapped to OTel `SeverityNumber`/`SeverityText` at emit time, so operational logs no longer arrive in Loki as UNKNOWN severity.

### Linear Rate-Limit Freeze Fixes

A cluster of fixes targeting the shared Linear bucket saturation that was freezing fleet dispatch and silently stalling replicas. Fence-guard reads are now cached (45s TTL), anchor UUID lookups are cached permanently, and dispatch reads route through the replica instead of hitting Linear live — together dropping breaker trips from ~18 per 3 minutes to near zero. A cloud-sync stall watchdog now detects frozen replica sockets and self-heals via process restart rather than sitting silent for hours, and interactive `claude` sessions now load plugins from `~/catalyst/plugin-source` on the same path as workers.

### Warm Resume & Replica-First Reads

A daemon restart now continues in-flight SDK work from its existing transcript instead of cold-restarting — making fleet-wide stop/restart-all a routine, low-cost operation. Alongside that, replica-first Linear reads are now a standard reflex across every agent path: enforced in core context, phase-worker preambles, and a new PreToolUse hook that can catch and block bare `linearis issues read` calls before they hit the rate-limited API key.

### SDK Worker Registry & Fleet Resilience

This release introduces a unified in-process SDK worker registry that tracks live workers with heartbeats, sticky abort semantics, and disk projections — closing the liveness blind spots that left the scheduler, delegate queue, and worktree refresh timer unable to see workers running outside the bg executor. Alongside that, a Linear quota storm can no longer freeze fleet admission: when the circuit breaker is open, a provably-real replica-empty is now trusted directly instead of looping into a failing linearis reconfirm. Agent reads also move off the `catalyst-linear` CLI to direct SQLite queries against the local replica, giving agents full join support and a single, well-defined freshness rule; `catalyst-linear` is now a deprecated shim.

### Linear Replica Board Discovery

All Linear reads in dispatched agents now route through the local Catalyst Cloud replica via `catalyst-linear`, eliminating the rate-limit burns and board freezes that were stalling the fleet. Discovery now gates on the writer heartbeat lock rather than WAL mtime, so quiet feeds stay replica-served instead of falling through to the API. Two telemetry gaps are also fixed: phase-turns events were wired to the wrong parameter and never reached the event log, and SDK workers were missing their Claude Code OTel metrics because the daemon env lacked the OTLP endpoint.

### Linear Replica & SDK Executor Hardening

This release wires up the full infrastructure for agents to read Linear from a local Catalyst Cloud replica instead of hitting the rate-limited API directly — including the new `catalyst-linear` CLI that reads the replica first and falls back to `linearis`, and a supervised per-node replica writer that keeps the local DB fresh on every node class. The SDK executor path gets two security and correctness fixes (token scrubbing on rejection, same-tick slot budget), plus a daemon launcher fix that ensures the OAuth token survives non-login restarts so `executor=sdk` no longer silently falls back to `bg`. Run `catalyst install --executor sdk` to provision the executor lever and cloud-sync writer together without regression.

### Per-Class Install Lifecycle

`catalyst install`, `uninstall`, and `reinstall` now work per node class — worker nodes get broker/exec-core/monitor daemons, developer and monitor nodes get the updater agent, and the distinction is enforced. Each run is a fully observable OTEL trace with phase-by-phase telemetry, automatic backup before any overwrite, and rollback to a known-good state if provisioning fails mid-flight. Use `--dry-run` to print the resolved plan for your node class before touching anything.

### Catalyst CLI Router & Node Backup

This release adds a top-level `catalyst` command that routes to all existing tools by verb (`start`, `stop`, `doctor`, `update`, and more), with any unrecognized subcommand auto-delegating to the matching `catalyst-<x>` script. Alongside it, `catalyst-backup` lets you snapshot a node's full restorable state — config, credentials, database, and daemon inventory — before any install or uninstall phase touches it, with a manifest-driven restore that refuses to run against a live node. The release also ships a completion-signal-driven Linear reconciler that moves tickets to Done only when work is explicitly declared complete, not inferred from PR events, and fixes two icon-picker recovery bugs where stale cached bundles and poisoned manifest promises left icons blank even after the dist was healthy.

### Node-Class Awareness & Fleet Observability

This release introduces node classes (`developer`, `worker`, `monitor`) as a first-class concept across the fleet — every telemetry signal now carries `catalyst.node.class`, and `catalyst-doctor` grades nodes against their class-specific rubric instead of treating every machine as a worker activation gate. The standalone `catalyst-updater` daemon ships as the new sole plugin-pull owner for daemonless developer nodes, with `verify-updater` and `verify-node` providing objective pass/fail smoke tests for the GATE-3 cutover. Scheduler reliability gets significant hardening: stale-fenced orphan dirs no longer burn Linear OAuth quota, timed-out `linearis` reads now trip the circuit breaker so a degraded pass short-circuits instead of paying the full cap N times, and the board now sources real ticket titles from the CTC replica instead of falling back to bare IDs.

### Board-Health Holistic Dispatch & Cloud Token Provisioning

Board-health now dispatches a single holistic recovery-pass delegate on enforce scans, carrying full board context to the anchored ticket rather than triggering per-move fan-out. A multi-host correctness fix ensures `selectAnchor` only picks tickets this host owns via HRW, so a foreign-owned anchor no longer silently blocks actuation of self-owned work. Separately, `CATALYST_CLOUD_TOKEN` is now provisioned into the machine-level environment from the cluster repo via a new projection script, with an advisory `doctor` check — local-only behavior is unchanged until you opt into the cloud path.

### Stale Worktree Reclamation & Fleet Hardening

The automated stale-worktree sweeper now uses a multi-signal classifier to distinguish safe-to-delete, salvageable, and active worktrees — with battery-aware deferral, a per-run removal cap, and OTel instrumentation per sweep. Alongside that, several fleet-reliability fixes land: the board dispatch gate now routes on delegate instead of assignee (unwedging boards where human assignment blocked every Todo ticket), the recovery-pass bounded-LLM FIX rung is repaired after a missing `evidence.signal` field made it structurally dead in production, and a daemon boot-breaking missing export from `config.mjs` is resolved. PWA push notifications for the orch-monitor and a gitleaks CI secret-scanning gate round out the release.

### Recovery Observability & Cache Coverage

The recovery delegate now emits `recovery.tick` and `recovery.decision` events to Loki on every pass, so you can finally distinguish a board where the delegate examined items and handed them to humans from one it silently never processed. Control-loop numerics from those events — plus scheduler parallelism and autotune gauges — are promoted into OTel attributes, making queue depth, action breakdowns, and decision rules chartable in dashboards. The board-cache reconciler also fixes a starvation bug where only the alphabetical prefix of tickets ever reconciled; per-tier rotation cursors now ensure both active-pipeline and Backlog tickets are covered across passes, which should clear the phantom "stuck" tickets that were showing as open PRs despite being done.

### Board Health & Log Observability

The broker now periodically reconciles board cache state and labels against live Linear, closing the gap where a missed webhook left tickets lying about their status indefinitely. Dead doc-phase workers that go transcript-silent are detected and reclaimed, unblocking slots that previously sat starved for up to six hours. Grafana Alloy is installed and auto-started per host to ship daemon logs into Loki, queryable by stable node name alongside the existing OTel event streams.

### Cross-Host Control Plane & Monitor Stability

This release lands the cross-host single control plane: multiple machines now publish and merge liveness heartbeats correctly, fixing a Linear GraphQL bug that silently blocked all cross-host heartbeat writes and a merge-ordering issue that caused the self-host to appear degraded. The broker now detects when the monitor goes silent (via an out-of-process ingestion-silence detector) and raises a disk-readable alarm instead of staying falsely green. A batch of monitor stability fixes ships alongside: RSS no longer ratchets to multi-GB from repeated full event-log reads, the icon picker's virtualizer scroll container renders correctly, stale dist chunks no longer accumulate across rebuilds, and the broker now runs `bun install` automatically when dependencies change after a pull.

### Cluster Control Plane & Autonomous Recovery

This release lands two major systems: a GitOps cluster control plane (`catalyst cluster sync`, `cluster-repo-first roster`, SOPS-encrypted secrets) and a fully wired autonomous recovery pass that now acts on stalled tickets rather than just classifying them — resolving merge conflicts, rebasing, and re-dispatching phases before escalating to a human. The reaper also gains the ability to auto-remove squash-merged worktrees, and N dashboard clients now share a single backend SSE tail instead of spawning separate full-log reads per connection.

### Multi-Node Cluster Onboarding & Failed-Phase Escalation

Two gaps that let work fall through silently are closed in this release: failed phases now surface identically to stalled ones — inbox row, amber nav dot, `/queue` Needs You bucket, and a Linear `needs-human` label with the worker's structured explanation attached. On the infrastructure side, `catalyst-join.sh` and `catalyst cluster join-token` make adding a second node a one-line operation: mint a short-TTL token on the seed, run the `curl | bash` on the joining node, and the script handles Tailscale preflight, bundle fetch, config merge, and service installation with full resumability on retry. This release also ships worker-dir GC to prevent per-tick I/O blowup as worker directories accumulate, the orch-monitor as an installable PWA, launchd auto-start via `catalyst-stack install-services`, and editable project settings saved server-side from the monitor.

### Process Pipeline Visualization & Fleet Stability

Click any worker row in the orch-monitor to see its real-time metrics and activity feed, plus a new `/process` route that maps the daemon's 9-phase FSM pipeline with live ticket dots overlaid on each phase. Desktop client launches server-agnostic with setup screen for any Catalyst instance. Critical fleet memory leak fixed — execution-core now runs for months without restart, with bounded background workers and job directory cleanup.

### Execution Tab & Governance Rulebook

Open any ticket in the orch-monitor and click the new Execution tab to see a structured breakdown of what happened — current phase, a narrative summary, phase Gantt with timings and idle gaps, artifacts table, and an exceptions list — without digging through logs. The Governance Rulebook (`/rules`, keyboard shortcut `g r`) surfaces all 17 belief-engine rules across 6 strata in Plain English, Datalog, and the exact SQL the engine runs, with live firing-rate badges when belief recording is active. Escalated tickets that hit the remediate cycle cap now show a CTA-led explanation card in the detail pane with the blocking finding, why the worker gave up, and what you need to decide — no more bare Respond buttons with no context. This release also fixes a silent 12-hour plugin-checkout outage caused by dirty worktrees, adds self-healing refresh with a checkout-lag alarm after consecutive failures, and patches a bash 3.2 crash that left the entire fleet down after a `catalyst-stack restart` with no arguments.

### Workers Dispatch/Board Split & Node Drain Mode

The Workers surface now splits into two dedicated screens — Dispatch (ControlTower) and Board (WorkerSwimlaneBoard) — toggled from the app-shell header, eliminating the sticky column header overlap and giving each view its own scroll container. Node drain mode lands alongside it: run `catalyst-execution-core drain` to stop a node from accepting new tickets while in-flight work finishes, with a HUD display and `--off` toggle to resume. This release also fixes phase workers stranding commits on transient `bgIsolation` branches, hardens the artifact gate to resolve paths against the ticket worktree rather than the process cwd, and prevents stale-ref PRs by push-verifying HEAD before announce and merge.

### Dispatch Board & Stall-Janitor Overhaul

This release is dense. The Queue surface is renamed Dispatch (with a `/queue` redirect for bookmarks), and the board now distinguishes held, retrying, and gave-up tickets with distinct chips and buckets instead of a blanket "waiting" label. A new stall-janitor (Pass 0j) detects orphaned worktrees and ghost sessions, auto-clears artifact-retry-exhausted stalls once a prior-phase artifact arrives, and ships a classify-then-act unstuck sweep (Pass 0u, opt-in via `CATALYST_UNSTUCK_SWEEP`) for the stalled/needs-human backlog. On the UI side, Cmd+K now covers actions, settings commands, and live ticket search; the sidebar shows per-project worker presence dots and inbox attention badges; and dead ghost sessions are correctly excluded from the admission-gate slot count so work stops getting blocked by terminal sessions that were never cleaned up.

### Observe Suite, Redesigned Shell & Agent Reliability

This release ships the full OBSERVE analytics suite (Telemetry, FinOps, and FleetOps surfaces with live Prometheus/Loki charts, cost breakdowns, and host health), a heavily reworked shell with unified routing, Linear-quality ticket detail pages, and a new swimlane board that shares one scroll axis across all groups. On the reliability side, workers now fence irreversible side-effects against cluster takeover, parked needs-input workers release their concurrency slot and resume when unblocked, and a belief-store rule layer tracks liveness, blocker rank, and escalation decisions each tick. The dirty-worktree rebase storm, boot-resume no-op, and stale eligible-projection bugs are also fixed.

### Cache-Backed Read-Model & Board Redesign Foundation

This release lays the architectural foundation for the upcoming board and detail-page redesign. The orchestration monitor's read-model now assembles once from durable caches and fans out to all clients — no more synchronous Linear API calls per request — and every BFF endpoint (ticket detail, artifacts, search, ticket run history) reads exclusively from broker-cached data. Alongside that, the board gains deep-linkable routes via TanStack Router, a single ordering source shared between the board and the detail pager, a typed read-model client contract enforced at compile time across the web UI and terminal HUD, and an edge-to-edge app shell built on the shadcn Sidebar primitive. Two dependency bugs are also fixed: epic-to-child deadlocks and false blockers from prose-scraped ticket mentions.

### Gherkin-Ticket Standard in Ticket Creation

New tickets created via the `linear` and `create-tickets` skills now automatically follow the gherkin-ticket format — outcome-first titles, use-case openers, and tiered Gherkin bodies with technical detail tucked under `## Technical notes`. Both paths enforce this as a hard gate, so the backlog can't drift back to mechanism-first titles. The `phase-triage` skill also assesses conformance and flags non-conformant tickets in triage comments, without touching classification logic or auto-rewriting anything.

### Gherkin Tickets & Scheduler Hardening

The new `gherkin-ticket` skill rewrites ticket authoring around use cases first: actor-led titles, tiered Gherkin scenarios, and a REWRITE mode that reorganizes without dropping technical detail. Auto-fires on ticket-creation language or invoke it directly as `/catalyst-dev:gherkin-ticket`. This release also closes several scheduler reliability gaps: pre-spawn orphan claims that wedged phases indefinitely are now reaped and retried, persistent per-team reconcile failures surface as visible events instead of silent starvation, and workspace-scoped label preflight no longer fires false alarms on every boot.

### Distributed Orchestration & Daemon Hardening

This release lays the foundation for multi-host orchestration: the scheduler now uses rendezvous hashing to partition ticket ownership across a cluster roster and soft-claims each ticket before dispatch, becoming a safe no-op on single-host setups until you add a second host to `.catalyst/hosts.json`. Alongside that, the daemon gets significant reliability improvements — phase workers now self-stop after emitting complete (eliminating 7-hour idle zombies), cold-start recovery distinguishes cheap phases (auto-resume) from expensive ones (operator greenlight required), and a new standalone `catalyst-agent` samples host metrics and Claude account rate-limit usage across multiple accounts. Fresh-machine setup is also substantially more reliable, with no-sudo install fallbacks, correct humanlayer and `gh` CLI install paths, and a vendored replacement for the crashing `humanlayer thoughts init` command.

### Compound Engineering Loop & Daemon Reliability

This release introduces the Compound Engineering MVP (Slice 1): phase skills now log per-ticket friction as work happens, `phase-research` injects relevant past learnings before starting, and the morning briefing surfaces a friction digest and pending compound decisions for approval. Alongside that, a significant batch of daemon reliability fixes lands — worktree removal now requires positive evidence of merged+clean+no-session+provenance before any deletion (closing a real data-loss vector), liveness snapshot wedges that held new-work dispatch indefinitely are resolved at both the population and in-tick aging layers, and per-tick Linear reads are batched into a single query to collapse what was ~3,000–4,400 individual ticket reads per hour down to one batched request per TTL window. The plugin layout also reorganizes: `catalyst-foundry` is a new plugin for framework setup skills, `catalyst-legacy` topology is corrected, and `compound` is renamed `compound-estimate` — update any slash-command references accordingly.

### Pre-Push Hook Suppression Fix

Automated phase-agent pushes no longer trigger locally-installed pre-push hooks (trunk, trufflehog, fmt, tests) that were causing CPU and memory spikes during concurrent worktree dispatches. The fix passes `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` per git call — no persistent config changes, no `--no-verify` — so your interactive pushes are completely unaffected.

### Ticket Gantt, Smarter Autotuner & Signal Reliability

Clicking a ticket card in the orchestration monitor now opens a three-tab drawer — a wall-clock Gantt of per-phase spans colored by phase type, a cost and token breakdown, and the full comms stream for that ticket. The autotuner gets two significant fixes: macOS hosts no longer false-clamp `maxParallel` to 1 due to `os.freemem()` under-reporting available memory, and scale decisions now attribute CPU and memory to Claude's own process tree so the tuner holds steady when another process is causing host pressure rather than shedding workers unnecessarily. A longstanding wedge where phase workers silently skipped the signal-file flip on `claude --bg` dispatch is also resolved by threading orchestrator context through the surviving `settings.env` channel.

### Autotuning Execution Core & Per-Worker Observability

The execution core now includes a setpoint-seeking autotuner that converges `maxParallel` toward a host-configurable target — including at idle, where it previously stalled at 1. Per-worker OpenTelemetry is fully wired into the background-worker model, so phase workers now emit correctly tagged metrics in Grafana, Dash0, and Honeycomb instead of untagged or mis-attributed signal. A reaper poll-fallback fix stops predecessor workers from leaking into `liveCount` and starving the parallel queue.

### Point-Driven Effort & Pipeline Reliability

Ticket point estimates now drive `--effort` flags and `/workflows` postamble automatically across the plan, implement, verify, and review phases — 1pt maps to medium, 3/5pt to high, and 8/13pt to xhigh with workflows. Four reliability fixes ship alongside: workers that die before their first turn now self-heal by re-issuing the phase command on revive; the orchestration monitor's Done column no longer surfaces mid-pipeline tickets that haven't reached monitor-deploy; parked workers no longer spuriously re-dispatch when the bot posts its own clarifying question; and `workflow_id` in the sessions table is no longer polluted with stale daemon session ids, making per-run cost attribution queries accurate.

### Deterministic Worker Lifecycle Engine

The revive-storm guard stack — roughly 14 heuristic dampers that tried to guess whether a worker was dead — is replaced by three deterministic primitives: an atomic single-flight claim with fencing tokens, a `state.json` death trigger that reads local lifecycle state instead of the eventually-consistent `claude agents` snapshot, and a progress probe that stops futile respawns by checking whether a worker actually made commits or produced output before deciding to revive it. Separately, per-step model, effort, and preamble overrides are now live in dispatch via a small rules engine in the workflow descriptor, so large or epic tickets can launch the plan worker with max effort and a different model while every other case stays byte-identical to before. The board real-time client also shifts to a SharedWorker with an IndexedDB cache, cutting upstream SSE connections to one per browser instead of one per tab.

### Live Worker/Ticket Board

The monitor now serves a real-time Worker and Ticket board at the default `/` route, replacing the old polling dashboard as the primary view (legacy dashboard still available at `/legacy`). Board data is pushed over SSE from a single shared snapshot — no more per-tab polling hammering the server — with updates triggered reactively on state changes rather than a fixed tick. The Workers view also gains a Status ↔ Pipeline column toggle so you can group live workers by liveness or by phase, and worker cards now show a session short-code to distinguish revived duplicate workers from the same ticket.

### Startup Triage Sweep Fix

Tickets already in an eligible state when the dev daemon boots — or that appear between webhook deliveries — now get triage dispatched automatically.

No migration needed.

### Scheduler Test Isolation Fix

Eight scheduler tests were silently failing on any machine with active background workers — CI passed because it runs sandboxed, masking a regression introduced by the CTL-705 preemption sweep. The fix injects `liveBackgroundCount: () => 0` into the affected test fixtures so local dev environments with live pipelines no longer see false failures. No production code changed and no migration is needed.

### Session Continuity & Linear Stability

This release focuses on two things: keeping phase workers alive across reboots and machine restarts, and stopping the Linear API rate-limit storms that were halting the execution-core daemon. Boot-resume now passes `--resume-session` so in-flight workers pick up where they left off instead of starting fresh, with a dual-schema fallback that handles both old and new Claude Code state formats. On the Linear side, a circuit breaker throttles retries on 429s, cross-team label errors are correctly classified as unrecoverable (ending the per-tick retry loops against ADV tickets), and per-event scoping polls are replaced with webhook-captured fields — cutting the baseline Linear call volume significantly. Several correctness fixes also land: the one-worker-per-ticket invariant is now enforced with a liveness gate, yield tombstones no longer crash the scheduler tick, and sub-agent costs are included in phase mirror footers.

Phase-agent workers spawned via `claude --bg` now inherit `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` from the orchestrator, so Grafana cost panels correctly attribute their spend to the right Linear ticket, branch, and project. Previously, those labels were empty and the "Cost by Linear Ticket" panel silently dropped phase-agent costs — in one dogfood run, ~75% of spend went unattributed. No migration steps required.


### Features

- **dev:** propagate OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES to phase-agent claude --bg children (CTL-492)

### Phase-Agent Pipeline Launch

This release ships the full 9-phase agent pipeline: triage → research → plan → implement → verify → review → PR → merge → deploy monitoring. Orchestrations now dispatch each phase as a `claude --bg` worker, advance automatically via broker `phase_lifecycle` events, and resume when a phase hits its turn cap rather than burning the error-recovery budget. Two blocking dispatch bugs (a skill gate that rejected slash-command invocation and a bg job ID parser that captured `backgrounded` instead of the hex ID) are also fixed, meaning this is the first release where phase workers can actually run end-to-end.

### HUD Overhaul & Broker Observability

This release is a substantial rework of the orchestration monitor HUD — raw event names in their own column, a unified Claude Code-style prompt input, sortable Workers/Orchestrators tabs, a new Runs tab showing the full orchestrator → worker hierarchy, and progressive Escape to undo one filter layer at a time. On the broker side, workers in wait states are now visible (with countdown timers in the HUD), stale-heartbeat wakes are batched per interest instead of flooding per session, and duplicate wakes are suppressed when CI conclusion hasn't changed. Every `catalyst-*` CLI now accepts `--version` to show the build SHA and source path, and `catalyst-broker probe` gives a fast O(1) daemon health check.

### Claude Code Session Metadata & HUD Overhaul

Session context is now tracked and surfaced throughout the toolchain: `catalyst-statusline.sh` emits `session.context` events with model, context %, token count, cost, and turn number on every status bar render, and the HUD and web UI display them inline per worker. The monitor HUD also gets a round of focused improvements — the SOURCE and EVENT columns are merged into a single responsive column, the `/` filter now substring-matches across every field in the raw event JSON (with AND semantics for multi-token queries), the footer compacts to two lines with width-responsive hotkey hints, and the scroll anchor bug that hid filter matches above the viewport is fixed. Run `catalyst-db.sh init` after updating to apply the new `claude_session_id` and `last_context_pct` columns.

### Broker Reliability & HUD Observability Overhaul

This release fixes a cascade of broker routing failures where canonical OTel event envelopes were being misread at multiple sites — `filter.register` events were silently ignored, deterministic PR routes never fired, and the Groq prose classifier was generating ~95% false positives (now gated off by default via `CATALYST_BROKER_PROSE_ENABLED=0`). The HUD gets substantial polish alongside: wake rows now show the target orchestrator and wake reason in context, SOURCE icons pick up Nerd Font glyphs, column widths adapt to terminal size, and a broker health chip surfaces interest count and API key status at a glance. Run `plugins/dev/scripts/clean-prose-interests.sh && catalyst-monitor restart` after updating to clear any stale test-residue interests from `~/catalyst/broker-interests.json`.

### Catalyst HUD Bottom-Anchored Panels

Detail panes and help overlays now anchor to the bottom of your terminal with the event list
expanding to fill all remaining space above. Event rows are self-explanatory — comms events show
sender/recipient/type, filter events display as "wake"/"filter reg" instead of truncated names, and
all text is cleaned of HTML/Markdown markup. Column headers stay pinned when detail panes are open,
and the core catalyst-pm plugin now focuses on 12 essential strategy/PRD skills with ops features
moved to dedicated sibling plugins.

### Event Log Analysis CLI

Query your event logs using either technical filters or plain English — get phase timing breakdowns,
identify orchestration stalls, and analyze CI funnels from JSONL logs. Natural language queries like
"show errors in the last hour" are translated to structured filters via Claude and work in both the
CLI and live TUI. Legacy event formats are now handled gracefully to prevent the catalyst-hud
loading hang.

### AI Activity Brief and Broker Evolution

The Catalyst plugin ecosystem now includes an AI-powered Activity Brief panel that generates
executive summaries of the last 30m/1h/6h of development activity, plus a new `/god` skill for
cross-project omniscient status monitoring. The core event filtering system has evolved into
`catalyst-broker` with structured agent identity, automatic PR correlation, and deterministic
routing for Linear ticket events. Run `catalyst-monitor.sh forward-start` to enable the new
OTLP/PostHog/Cloudflare Analytics Engine telemetry forwarder that ships canonical events to external
observability platforms.

### Groq-Powered Semantic Event Routing

The catalyst-filter daemon now routes GitHub webhook and Linear events through Groq Llama 3.1 8B,
letting orchestrators register natural-language intents instead of writing complex jq filters.
Bidirectional comms enable mid-flight orchestrator messages to workers, and heartbeat watchdog
detection catches stalled workers without LLM calls. Install the new CLIs with
`catalyst-filter start` and `setup-webhooks.sh --register-github-hooks`.

### Webhook Auto-Registration & Verification Fixes

The `setup-webhooks.sh` script now auto-registers Linear webhooks with
`--linear-register --webhook-url <url>`, eliminating the manual GraphQL mutation step that
previously blocked event-driven workflows. Fixed four critical bugs in `orchestrate-verify.sh` that
caused verification failures on merged PRs and produced malformed output with integer comparison
errors. Existing GitHub webhook subscriptions automatically upgrade to include `release` and
`workflow_run` events on daemon restart.

### Orchestrator-Driven Deploy Lifecycle

Worker definition-of-done now extends through production deploy success, with orchestrator managing
the merging → merged → deploying → done state machine after workers exit at "merging". Event-driven
GitHub deployment monitoring replaces polling across skills like merge-pr and orchestrate. New
`catalyst-events` CLI provides tail and wait-for primitives over the unified GitHub/Linear/comms
activity log, while Linear webhooks join GitHub webhooks for comprehensive event ingestion.

### Linear UUID Caching

New `resolve-linear-ids.sh` script fetches and caches Linear team and workflow state UUIDs to reduce
API rate limiting during issue transitions. The `linear-transition.sh` command now reads cached
UUIDs from `.catalyst/config.json` instead of making repeated API calls, with full backward
compatibility when cache is absent.

### Orchestration Monitor Refresh

Unified Kanban board with view toggles, project filters, and GitHub-style PR status indicators
across home, orchestration, and worker views. Worker detail pages now show hero metrics (elapsed
time, tokens, cost) above the phase timeline, while the orchestration view promotes todos to the top
with an expanded 5-column worker board. Polling loops now include explicit sleep intervals to
prevent GitHub API rate limit exhaustion.

### Shell Evaluation CWD Fixes

Fixed Warp terminal integration where `--shell-eval` mode would show incorrect directory paths,
create unwanted shell block splits, and kill the tab's shell on Claude exit. Warp's file explorer
and path indicator now correctly track worktree directories, and Claude sessions return cleanly to
your shell without spawning extra blocks.

### Warp Tab Directory Tracking

The `launch-worktree-tab.sh` script now supports `--shell-eval` mode to properly set the working
directory in Warp tabs. When you open Catalyst worktree tabs, Warp's path indicator will now show
the actual worktree path instead of defaulting to the main checkout directory.

### Session Outcome & Iteration Tracking

Catalyst now emits session outcome events (`success`, `fail`, `abandoned`) and iteration counters to
your observability stack, enabling cost-per-successful-outcome analysis and complexity measurement.
The `claude_code_iteration_count_total` metric tracks plan-replan and implement-fix cycles
separately, giving you visibility into which tickets require more rework. Run your database
migrations to add the new session tracking columns.

### Session State Tracking & Restart

Active sessions now show liveness status and crash detection via `catalyst-session.sh status`, with
automated restart commands for crashed Claude sessions that preserves your conversation history.
Orchestrator worktrees get readable names like `orch-deal-to-opportunity-2026-04-25` and write
completion markers for clear done/in-progress distinction. Post-merge verification runs
automatically on merged PRs when `allowSelfReportedCompletion` is disabled, filing remediation
tickets instead of blocking merge.

### Canonical Wave Dispatch & Chrome Navigation

The orchestration dispatcher now reads all waveN queues dynamically instead of hardcoded wave
limits, so you can dispatch wave5 or wave10 without manual script edits. Click the Catalyst logo to
return to the mockup gallery, use the new breadcrumb navigation, or press ⌘K for a filterable
command palette with nav shortcuts and appearance controls. Worker usage and costs now aggregate
correctly into state.json during monitoring phases.

### Loki-Backed Monitoring Panels

OTel configuration now supports project-scoped files and the monitoring dashboard displays live tool
usage metrics and API error feeds pulled from Loki. The tool usage panel shows your top-8 most
invoked tools over the last hour, while the error feed displays the 5 most recent API failures with
timestamps. Both panels automatically hide when OTel is unconfigured and poll every 30 seconds
alongside your existing health checks.

### Orchestrator Intelligence & Communications

Three productivity-focused areas land in the monitor: a restructured dashboard puts "what needs me?"
first without scrolling, a new Comms view surfaces real-time catalyst-comms channels with live
message feeds and cross-links from worker activity, and orchestrator briefings now include an
auto-generated rollup that aggregates what shipped across all waves. Worker cost tooltips explain
when metrics are unavailable, and PR status badges show merge conflicts or blocks at a glance across
tables and cards.

### PM Parallel Orient Delegates

PM kickoff now dispatches three parallel sub-agents for orientation instead of running raw CLI
fetches in the main context. This reduces a typical PM session start from ~15 tool calls with 30KB
of JSON debris down to 3-4 clean tool calls, keeping the main context focused on PM reasoning rather
than data collection.

### Worktree One-Shot Development Pipeline

Create a ticket worktree and launch Claude with the full research-to-ship pipeline pre-queued in one
command. The new Warp tab variant runs `/catalyst-dev:oneshot {{ticket}}` automatically after
worktree creation, enabling walk-away autonomous development workflows. Also adds PM kickoff prompts
and fixes symlink preservation when copying plugin directories into new worktrees.

### Thoughts Profile Drift Repair

The `catalyst-thoughts.sh init-or-repair` command now automatically detects and fixes profile drift
between your `.catalyst/config.json` and humanlayer's repo mapping. When drift is detected, it runs
`humanlayer thoughts uninit --force` followed by re-init with the correct profile and directory from
your config. Previously, drift would cause silent failures that required manual intervention.

### Thoughts Symlink Protection

`setup-catalyst` no longer silently clobbers thoughts symlinks when repairing directory structure.
The new `catalyst-thoughts.sh` helper detects when a regular directory has replaced an expected
symlink and refuses to auto-fix, instead showing a recovery command to preserve any files written to
the wrong location. Health checks now treat clobbered symlinks as fatal errors when humanlayer is
configured.

### Warp Color Variant Fix

The `setup-warp` skill now only offers Warp's 8 valid color variants (`black`, `red`, `green`,
`yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`) instead of invalid options like `purple` and `pink`
that caused Warp to reject generated tab configs on load.

### PRs

### Warp Helper Script Bundling

The `setup-warp` skill now bundles its helper scripts directly in the plugin instead of referencing
dotfiles that don't exist for other users. Generated Warp tab configurations will point to the
bundled `open-project-tab.sh` and `trust-workspace.sh` scripts, making the plugin work out of the
box for everyone.

### Auto Orchestration & Warp Integration

Run `catalyst orchestrate --auto N` to automatically pick your top priority tickets from Linear, or
use the new `/catalyst-dev:setup-warp` skill to generate terminal tab configs that launch
orchestration sessions with proper naming and remote control. The `--reuse-existing` flag on
worktree creation means your tab configs can safely reopen long-lived development environments
without conflicts.

### Auto-Dispatch Fixup Workers

Blocked PRs with unresolved review threads or failed checks now automatically trigger fixup workers
after a 10-minute stabilization window, capping at 2 attempts before escalating to human attention.
The orchestrator polls BLOCKED states alongside existing DIRTY/BEHIND handling, eliminating the need
for manual intervention on stuck PRs. New signal tracking includes `blockedSince`, `fixupAttempts`,
and `lastFixupDispatchedAt` for dashboard visibility.

### API Stream Idle Detection

Workers now recover immediately when hitting Claude API stream idle timeouts, instead of waiting up
to 15 minutes for heartbeat staleness detection. Linear ticket states automatically transition when
PRs are merged, with retroactive reconciliation available via `orchestrate-bulk-close` for tickets
that stayed in "In Review" after successful merges.

### Authoritative Git and PR State

Workers are no longer marked as "stalled" based solely on signal file age — the orchestrator now
uses git commit history and GitHub PR status as ground truth for completion detection. If a worker
merged its PR but died before writing the terminal signal, it's correctly recognized as complete
rather than stalled. Run the orchestration monitor to see the improved accuracy in worker lifecycle
tracking.

### Worker Cost Display Fix

Dashboard now shows real-time worker costs (USD, input/output tokens, cache reads) instead of
placeholder dashes. The orchestrator writes parsed usage data to each worker's signal file, matching
the existing global state format that powers the cost overview.

### PRs

- **dev:** write worker cost to signal file in orchestrator (CTL-88)

### Session Resume Orchestration

When workers die mid-merge or stall with heartbeats, the orchestrator now revives them using
`claude --resume <session_id>` instead of starting fresh — preserving full context while cutting
costs ~10×. The system resolves session IDs from worker output streams and enforces per-ticket
revive budgets, transitioning to stalled status when revival isn't possible.

### Orchestration State Isolation

Orchestrator runtime state now lives in `~/catalyst/runs/<orch-id>/` instead of git worktrees,
keeping your worktree clean during runs. Output files move to `workers/output/` to reduce noise,
while worker signal files stay in their expected locations. The monitor automatically handles both
new runs-based and legacy worktree-based orchestrators.

### Merged PR Status Writeback

The orchestration monitor now writes merged PR status back to worker signal files when it detects
PRs have been merged on GitHub. Previously, merged PRs were only tracked in memory, causing the
dashboard to show incorrect completion percentages when the orchestrator agent had already exited.
Signal files now automatically update with `status=done`, `phase=6`, and merge timestamps for
accurate project tracking.

### Orchestrator Launch Failure Detection

Workers that die immediately after dispatch (bad flags, environment errors) are now detected within
30 seconds instead of waiting 15 minutes for the stalled-worker detector. The orchestrator runs a
batch health check after each dispatch wave, verifying worker PIDs and automatically flagging
dead-on-arrival processes as failed with attention items.

### Agent Communication Channels

The new `catalyst-comms` CLI gives Claude Code agents file-based communication across worktrees,
sub-agents, and orchestrators without requiring servers or HTTP dependencies. Agents can join
channels, send messages, poll for updates, and coordinate completion through simple bash commands
that work with any agent workflow. Channel activity is logged locally at `~/catalyst/comms/` with
automatic cleanup and human audit capabilities via `catalyst-comms watch` and `status`.

### Claude Worker Dispatch Fixes

Fixed broken worker dispatch where the `-w` flag was incorrectly used with paths instead of names,
causing "Invalid worktree name" errors. Workers now launch in a backgrounded subshell with proper
directory switching, include `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to prevent TTY blocking, and capture
stderr to debuggable log files instead of `/dev/null`.

### Changelog Backfill and CI API Key Fix

Backfills AI-enhanced summaries for the four most recent releases (6.34.1 through 6.36.0) that
shipped after the original backfill PR. Updates both release-note scripts to use
`LOCAL_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to avoid conflicts with Claude Code's own

### AI-Enhanced Changelogs and Homepage Badge

All 51 catalyst-dev changelog entries now have Sonnet-generated titles and 2-4 sentence summaries.
The website homepage gains a version badge that reads the latest release from CHANGELOG.md at build
time. Changelog page styling follows a Conductor-inspired layout with small muted version numbers,
bold release titles, and comfortable reading line-height. CI release note generation upgraded from
Haiku to Sonnet, and a new `add-changelog-media` skill supports R2/CDN hosting for screenshots and
GIF screencasts.

### Activity Feed and Task List Integration

The orchestration monitor activity feed now shows tool names, text previews, and rate limit info
instead of generic "new turn" labels. A new task list integration reads from
`~/.claude/tasks/{sessionId}/` to display per-worker task progress with badges in the worker table
and a collapsible task section in the detail drawer.

### Watcher Subshell Detach

Adds `disown` after the background watcher subshell in `catalyst-claude.sh` to fully detach it from
bash's job table before `exec` replaces the process. This is a defensive fix that prevents any edge
case where bash might send SIGHUP to the watcher on exit.

### Warp Terminal Integration

Replaces child-process `claude "$@"` with `exec claude "$@"` in the session wrapper so the process
image becomes `claude` directly, restoring Warp's rich sidebar metadata (repo, branch, change count)
and notification integration. Heartbeat and cleanup logic moves to a background watcher that polls
the wrapper PID.

### Session Time Filter Controls

Filter your Claude sessions in the sidebar by time range with a 5-option toggle
(Active/1h/24h/48h/All) that replaces the previous hardcoded 1-hour cutoff. The filter setting
persists across page reloads and works in both flat and grouped sidebar modes. Your previous "Active
sessions only" behavior is preserved as the default filter option.

### Linear Ticket Grouping

The orchestration monitor sidebar now groups sessions and orchestrators by Linear ticket ID when you
select "ticket" grouping mode. Sessions group by their ticket field, while orchestrators appear in
groups for each worker ticket they manage. Items without tickets collect in an "Unlinked" group at
the bottom.

### DeepWiki Codebase Integration

The research-codebase workflow now starts by querying DeepWiki for a compressed map of your
repository, making all subsequent AI research targeted instead of exploratory. All core Catalyst
skills can now ask DeepWiki specific questions during execution, and oneshot workflow eliminates 16
lines of duplicate research logic by referencing the unified research process.

### Monitor Command Consolidation

The `start-monitor.sh` script has been merged into `catalyst-monitor.sh` as a single entry point for
all monitoring operations. Use `catalyst-monitor.sh start` instead of the separate bootstrap script

### Setup Health Check System

Run `/catalyst-dev:setup-catalyst` to diagnose your entire Catalyst installation with 47 automated
checks covering database, monitoring, secrets, and project configuration. The skill auto-fixes safe
issues like missing directories and database initialization, then re-verifies everything in one
command. The orchestration monitor now shows version info in the header and includes a smarter
launcher that validates prerequisites and handles dependency installation automatically.

### Standalone Orchestrator Setup

The new `setup-orchestrator.sh` script lets you bootstrap orchestrator worktrees from Warp tabs,
cron jobs, or any external automation without needing a Claude Code session. It supports ticket
pass-through, quiet mode for scripting, and one-shot launch flags while maintaining full
compatibility with the existing `/catalyst-dev:setup-orchestrate` skill. Also fixes the
orchestration monitor dashboard which was showing zero orchestrators due to incorrect SSE event
parsing.

### Modern React Orchestration Monitor

The orchestration monitor is now a React SPA with shimmer loading, worker search/filtering, animated
KPIs, and a collapsible sidebar. Code-split lazy loading reduces initial bundle size while 15+
componentized views replace the previous 4000-line vanilla JavaScript implementation. All existing
orchestrator functionality (Overview, Workers, Timeline, Events tabs) works identically with
improved performance and modern SaaS-style UX.

### Multi-Frontend SSE Event Architecture

Catalyst now sends all orchestration events through a standardized envelope format with filtering
support. Connect multiple frontends or tools to the same session using SSE query params like
`?filter=session-update,metrics-update` or `?session=abc123` to get only the events you need. The
new typed event system supports session updates, metrics changes, and annotation events with
automatic envelope wrapping for consistent downstream processing.

### SQLite Session Integration

Solo Claude Code sessions now appear directly in the orchestration monitor alongside workflow
workers, giving you one unified view of all AI development activity. The session store reader
integrates with existing filesystem monitoring, so you can track and filter both orchestrated and
standalone sessions through the same `/api/sessions` endpoint and live SSE streams.

### Session Lifecycle CLI

The new `catalyst-session` command gives any skill a universal interface to report lifecycle events,
metrics, and tool usage to the SQLite session store. Replace direct JSON file writes with structured
calls like `catalyst-session start --skill myskill`, `catalyst-session phase $id running`, and
`catalyst-session metric $id --cost 0.05` to get automatic tracking in the orchestration monitor and
session APIs.

### SQLite Session Store

Catalyst now persists all agent activity—both solo and orchestrated sessions—to a durable SQLite
database instead of fragile per-worker JSON files. The new `catalyst-db.sh` CLI provides session
CRUD, event logging, metrics tracking, and PR management with concurrent read/write support. Run
`catalyst-db.sh init` to create the database schema and start building persistent workflow history.

### Pre-assigned Migration Numbers

The orchestrator now reserves sequential Supabase migration numbers for database tickets during wave
briefing, preventing filename collisions when multiple workers generate migrations in parallel.
Migration-likely tickets are detected via labels (`database`, `migration`, `schema`) and keywords,
then assigned unique `NNN_` prefixes that appear in the briefing's new Migration Number Assignments
section.

### Fix-up and Follow-up Recovery Patterns

Two new orchestration patterns handle post-merge issues: fix-up workers push targeted commits to
open PRs when reviewers find blockers, while follow-up workers create new Linear tickets and fresh
worktrees for issues discovered after merge. Use `orchestrate-fixup` and `orchestrate-followup`
scripts to dispatch the appropriate recovery pattern based on your PR state.

### Orchestrator-Controlled Merge Polling

Workers now exit cleanly after opening PRs with auto-merge armed, while the orchestrator handles the
long poll until actual merge completion. This fixes premature worker termination issues where
subprocess workers would exit before PRs were fully merged, with the orchestrator taking over merge
monitoring duties and updating worker status when PRs complete.

### Worker Worktree Context Fix

Fixed ticket extraction in worker worktrees so branches like `orch-data-import-2026-04-13-ADV-220`
correctly identify `ADV-220` as the current ticket instead of false matches from orchestrator
prefixes. Worker worktrees now include an `orchestration` field in their workflow context, enabling
proper telemetry grouping across orchestrator and worker sessions.

### PR Polling Through Merge

Orchestrated workers now actively poll PR state, CI status, and review comments until merge
completion instead of exiting after creating the PR. The verification script independently confirms
PRs reached MERGED state, catching any workers that ignore polling instructions. Workers wait a
minimum 3 minutes then poll every 30 seconds with concrete step-by-step instructions.

### Linearis Command Consolidation

Removed duplicated Linear CLI commands from 8 files, making the linearis skill the single source of
truth for all command syntax and options. Fixed a setup validation false positive that incorrectly

instead of maintaining their own stale command examples.

### Orchestration Monitor

Live dashboard tracks your orchestrator runs in real-time with worker status, phase timelines, and
cost analytics. See which workers need attention, browse wave briefings, and analyze parallelism
efficiency across completed runs. Launch with `plugins/dev/scripts/orch-monitor` from any workspace
with orchestrator history.

### Zero-Interaction Orchestration Setup

The `setup-orchestrate` command now runs without any prompts or menus — just pass your ticket IDs
and it creates the worktree, generates a date-based orchestrator name, and prints the next command
to run. It hard-stops if run from a worktree instead of asking whether to continue, keeping setup
predictable and fast.

### Setup Orchestrate Skill

The new `/catalyst-dev:setup-orchestrate` skill creates a bootstrapped orchestrator worktree and
outputs a single copy-paste command to launch your run — no more manual shell scripting. Worktrees
are now automatically trusted in Claude Code during creation, eliminating the trust dialog when you
open them.

### Global Orchestration State Tracking

All active orchestrators are now tracked in a queryable global state registry with event logging and
token usage monitoring. The orchestrator automatically syncs worker progress, captures costs from
Claude CLI output, and maintains an audit trail in monthly-rotated event logs. Workers report status
to the global state and raise attention flags when blocked, giving you full visibility into
multi-agent workflows through `catalyst-state.sh` queries or dashboard integrations.

### Smart Merge Blocker Diagnosis

The merge-pr skill now queries GitHub's full merge state to identify specific blockers (failing CI,
unresolved review threads, missing approvals, outdated branches) and automatically resolves what it
can in a unified loop. When blockers can't be auto-fixed, you get actionable guidance like which
reviewers to request or which files have conflicts — never generic "branch protection is blocking"
errors. The new review-comments skill resolves GitHub review threads after addressing each comment,
and oneshot workflows now wait for automated reviewers before attempting merge.

### Parallel Development Orchestration

The new `/orchestrate` skill coordinates multiple development tasks simultaneously by taking Linear
tickets, creating isolated worktrees, and dispatching `/oneshot` workers in parallel with built-in
quality gates. Worktree creation now supports config-driven setup through `catalyst.worktree.setup`,
letting you customize initialization commands instead of relying on auto-detection. Each
orchestrated worker runs with adversarial verification that checks for reward hacking and ensures
delivery quality across all parallel streams.

### Workflow State Migration

Catalyst workflow state now lives in `.catalyst/` instead of `.claude/`, keeping your Claude Code
config separate from Catalyst's project files. All scripts automatically fall back to the old
location for backward compatibility, and `check-project-setup.sh` handles the migration on first
run. A new `resolve-ticket.sh` script provides consistent ticket resolution across all workflows
with smart fallback from branch names to workflow context.

### Dev Skills v2 Quality Gates

New `/validate-type-safety` and `/review-comments` skills join enhanced versions of
`/scan-reward-hacking`, `/oneshot`, and `/implement-plan` with built-in quality gate pipelines. The
`/oneshot` skill now handles smart PR creation with CI auto-fix loops, while `/implement-plan` runs
a 4-step validation pipeline after implementation phases. All skills include improved descriptions
for better autocomplete discovery and fixed agent references for more reliable execution.

### TDD Integration & Workflow Context

Claude plugins now enforce Test-Driven Development across all planning and implementation skills,

### Wiki-Links and PM Path Restructuring

The dev plugin now generates Obsidian-style `[[filename]]` wiki-links in skill templates for cleaner
document cross-references, while keeping filesystem paths intact for CLI and code references. PM
skills have been reorganized from scattered `thoughts/shared/*` locations into a unified
`thoughts/shared/pm/` and `thoughts/shared/product/` structure, eliminating the separate

### Smart Workflow Context & Browser Automation

Catalyst now automatically tracks research-to-plan-to-implementation lineage via workflow context
and document frontmatter, eliminating the need to manually chain commands. New browser automation
support lets Claude interact with web UIs directly for testing and data collection. Configuration
must now be nested under the 'catalyst' key in .claude/config.json, and Linear state transitions are
fully configurable through the stateMap setting.

### Agent Browser & Linear Workflow

Claude can now automate web browsers through the new agent-browser skill, handling authentication
flows and UI testing automatically when you mention browser tasks. Linear workflows get smoother
with automatic ticket state transitions during planning and implementation, plus better team UUID
resolution to prevent silent team-switching bugs. All config files now use the canonical
`catalyst`-wrapped structure for consistency.
