# Orchestrate

Coordinate multiple Linear tickets in parallel across git worktrees. The orchestrator creates
worktrees, dispatches `/oneshot` workers, tracks progress via a dashboard, and enforces quality
gates through adversarial verification. **The orchestrator NEVER writes application code** — it only
coordinates, monitors, and verifies.

> **Two dispatch modes.** With the default `catalyst.orchestration.dispatchMode: "oneshot-legacy"`,
> each ticket gets one long `claude -p` `/catalyst-dev:oneshot` worker that runs the full lifecycle.
> With `dispatchMode: "phase-agents"`, the orchestrator dispatches nine short-lived `claude --bg`
> phase skills (`phase-triage` … `phase-monitor-deploy`) per ticket, advancing on
> `phase.<name>.complete.<ticket>` broker events. The phase-agents mode is the post-2026-06-15 path
> that keeps worker dispatch on the subscription pool. See
> [Phase agents](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai/reference/orchestration/phase-agents/) for the
> pipeline, model assignment, cost economics, and the end-to-end runbook.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Resolve the shared catalyst-dev scripts dir (skills live in catalyst-legacy; scripts stay in
# catalyst-dev). Fail fast with an actionable message if catalyst-dev is not installed.
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/legacy}/scripts/require-catalyst-dev.sh" \
    "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/legacy}" || exit 1

# 1. Git (REQUIRED)
if ! command -v git &>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Git is required"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Linearis CLI (REQUIRED for ticket reading)
# See /catalyst-dev:linearis for CLI syntax reference
if ! command -v linearis &>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Linearis CLI required for ticket intake"
  echo "Install: npm install -g linearis"
  exit 1
fi

# 3. GitHub CLI (REQUIRED for PR monitoring)
if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: GitHub CLI required for PR/CI monitoring"
  exit 1
fi

# 4. Claude CLI (REQUIRED for worker dispatch)
if ! command -v claude &>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Claude CLI required for worker dispatch"
  exit 1

# 5. Project setup (REQUIRED — thoughts, config, workflow context)
if [[ -f "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/check-project-setup.sh" ]]; then
  "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/check-project-setup.sh" || exit 1
fi
```

| `--state-on-merge <name>` | Linear state to set on PR merge. Default: `stateMap.done` (typically "Done")                                                                          |
| `--stop`                  | Print how to deregister an `execution-core` project (edit the central registry) and exit. Works regardless of the configured `dispatchMode`. |

## Configuration

Reads orchestration config from `.catalyst/config.json` (or `.claude/config.json` if `.catalyst/`
doesn't exist). Falls back to sensible defaults if no orchestration block exists.

```json
{
  "catalyst": {
    "orchestration": {
      "worktreeDir": null,
      "maxParallel": 3,
      "hooks": {
        "setup": [],
        "teardown": []
      },
      "workerCommand": "/catalyst-dev:oneshot",
      "workerModel": "opus",
      "dispatchMode": "phase-agents",
      "thoughts": {
        "profile": null,
        "directory": null
      },
      "testRequirements": {
        "backend": ["unit"],
        "frontend": ["unit"],
        "fullstack": ["unit"]
      },
      "verifyBeforeMerge": true,
      "allowSelfReportedCompletion": false
    }
  }
}
```

**`dispatchMode` (CTL-452):**

- `"phase-agents"` (default after Phase 6 lands) — the orchestrator dispatches 9 short-lived phase
  agents per ticket via `claude --bg` (subscription pool). Phase 4 monitor subscribes a broker
  `phase_lifecycle` interest per ticket and advances on
  `phase.<name>.{complete,skipped}.<TICKET>` events via the `orchestrate-phase-advance` helper
  (CTL-512: `skipped` is a monitor-deploy terminal-no-deploy status routed the same as `complete`).
- `"oneshot-legacy"` — the orchestrator dispatches one long `claude -p oneshot` worker per ticket.
  Kept for rollback safety; flipping a single config key reverts to the pre-CTL-452 behavior.
- `"execution-core"` (CTL-554, CTL-582) — daemon-served. `/orchestrate` runs no wave loop and no
  Phase 4 session: it just ensures the single machine-level execution-core daemon is running and
  exits. Enrolled projects are the central registry `~/catalyst/execution-core/registry.json`
  (maintained by `setup-execution-core-states.sh`); the daemon watches that file and serves each
  team by composing the CTL-535 monitor, CTL-536 scheduler, and CTL-539 recovery modules.

The `workerCommand` field is still honored in legacy mode. In phase-agents mode it is unused (each
phase has its own canonical skill).

See config template for full schema documentation.

## Core Principle: The Orchestrator Never Writes Code

The orchestrator operates ONLY from its own worktree. It:

- Creates/removes worker worktrees
- Dispatches worker sessions (via `claude` CLI with streaming JSON output)
- Reads status from worker signal files and git
- Writes dashboard and briefing documents for the human
- Runs adversarial verification agents in worker worktrees
- Updates Linear ticket states when workers fail to do so

It NEVER:

- Modifies application code
- Writes test code
- Changes configuration in worker worktrees
- Commits to worker branches

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Intake & Dependency Analysis

1. **Resolve tickets**: Based on invocation mode, use the Linearis CLI to fetch ticket data. **For
   exact CLI syntax, run `linearis issues usage` or `linearis cycles usage`** — do not guess.
   - Explicit IDs: read each ticket's full details
   - `--project`: list issues filtered by project name
   - `--cycle current`: list the active cycle, then list its issues
   - `--file`: read IDs from file, then read each ticket's details
   - `--auto <N>`: list `status=Todo` issues, then select the top N. Ranking: urgent/high priority
     first (Linear priority 1 = Urgent → 4 = Low, with 0 = "No priority" sorted LAST), then newest
     `createdAt` first. Example jq after `linearis issues list --status Todo`:
     `sort_by((if .priority == 0 then 5 else .priority end), (-(.createdAt | fromdateiso8601))) | .[:N]`
     Present the auto-picked tickets to the user as part of the wave plan before proceeding.

2. **Read ticket details**: For each ticket, extract:
   - Title, description, estimate
   - Dependencies (linked blocking/blocked-by issues)
   - Labels (to detect scope: backend, frontend, fullstack)

3. **Build dependency graph**: Identify which tickets in the set depend on each other.

4. **Group into waves**:
   - **Wave 1**: tickets with no dependencies on other tickets in the set
   - **Wave 2**: tickets that depend only on Wave 1 tickets
   - **Wave N**: tickets that depend on Wave N-1 tickets
   - Tickets with circular dependencies → flag to user, do NOT proceed

5. **Present wave plan for approval**:

```
Orchestration Plan — "api-redesign"
Total: 6 tickets | 3 waves | Max parallel: 3

Wave 1 (parallel, 3 workers):
  PROJ-101: Auth middleware rewrite [backend, 3pt]
  PROJ-102: Rate limiting service [backend, 2pt]
  PROJ-103: Email templates [frontend, 1pt]

Wave 2 (after Wave 1, 2 workers):
  PROJ-104: OAuth integration [fullstack, 5pt] — depends on PROJ-101
  PROJ-105: API usage dashboard [frontend, 3pt] — depends on PROJ-102

Wave 3 (after Wave 2, 1 worker):
  PROJ-106: Self-service API keys [fullstack, 5pt] — depends on PROJ-104, PROJ-105

Estimated waves: 3 sequential rounds
Proceed? [Y/n]
```

6. **If `--dry-run`**: Print wave plan and exit.

### Phase 2: Provision Worktrees

Determine worktree base directory (in priority order):

1. `catalyst.orchestration.worktreeDir` from config
2. `${GITHUB_SOURCE_ROOT}/<org>/<repo>-worktrees/` (from env var + git remote)
3. `~/wt/<repo>/` (fallback)

**Read config for orchestration settings:**

```bash
# Resolve config file (.catalyst/ first, then .claude/)
CONFIG_FILE=""
for CFG in ".catalyst/config.json" ".claude/config.json"; do
  if [ -f "$CFG" ]; then CONFIG_FILE="$CFG"; break; fi
done

# Read orchestration config (all have defaults)
WORKTREE_DIR=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.worktreeDir // empty' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
MAX_PARALLEL=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.maxParallel // 3' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
SETUP_HOOKS=$(jq -c '.catalyst.orchestration.hooks.setup // []' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
TEARDOWN_HOOKS=$(jq -c '.catalyst.orchestration.hooks.teardown // []' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
WORKER_COMMAND=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.workerCommand // "/catalyst-dev:oneshot"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)

# CTL-208: workerCommand must be plugin-namespaced (/<plugin>:<skill>). A bare /oneshot
# becomes literal prompt text and the worker silently no-ops. Fail loudly here.
if [[ ! "$WORKER_COMMAND" =~ ^/[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*:[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$ ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: catalyst.orchestration.workerCommand=\"$WORKER_COMMAND\" must be plugin-namespaced (/<plugin>:<skill>), e.g. /catalyst-dev:oneshot. Update $CONFIG_FILE." >&2
  exit 2
fi

WORKER_MODEL=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.workerModel // "opus"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
VERIFY_BEFORE_MERGE=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.verifyBeforeMerge // "true"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
ALLOW_SELF_REPORTED=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.allowSelfReportedCompletion // "false"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)

# CTL-554: dispatchMode drives the execution-core fork below (after Phase 2).
DISPATCH_MODE=$(jq -r '.catalyst.orchestration.dispatchMode // "oneshot-legacy"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
```

**Linear App-Actor Identity (CTL-550, CTL-749)**

`catalyst.monitor.linear.botUserId` is **required for the Linear app-actor comms channel — i.e.
when the execution-core daemon mirrors phase-agent output to Linear and wakes on human replies
(CTL-550 / CTL-549 / CTL-749)**. It must be set **before** the daemon starts. The daemon reads it
from the project's Layer-1 committed config at the flat path
`<project>/.catalyst/config.json` → `catalyst.monitor.linear.botUserId` (not the Layer-2 home
config, not a team-keyed sub-object). This is the Linear user UUID of the Catalyst app-actor (the
"Linear for Agents" app user) — workspace-specific, and `null` in the committed config template.
See `/catalyst-foundry:setup-catalyst` for how to obtain it (query `viewer.id` with the app-actor
token). (The execution-core daemon is the pull-based runner of the phase-agent pipeline; it is not
a `dispatchMode` enum value — those are `phase-agents` and `oneshot-legacy`.)

The daemon reads `botUserId` only at startup and uses it to filter the agent's own mirror activity
out of the bidirectional Linear comms channel (CTL-749/CTL-549): it suppresses bot-authored comments
and description updates so they are not written into `workers/<ticket>/inbox.jsonl` as input. Without
it, the daemon cannot tell the agent's own comments/updates apart from a human's, so every mirror
comment lands in the worker inbox as a false "human replied" signal (noise / write loops). It is
the self-echo / loop-prevention guard.

**Create ALL worktrees using `create-worktree.sh`** — both orchestrator and workers go through the
same script so they all get `.claude/`, `.catalyst/`, dependency install, thoughts init, and custom
hooks:

```bash
# The create-worktree.sh script lives relative to this plugin
SCRIPT="${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/create-worktree.sh"

# Resolve --worktree-dir to pass through (omit flag if not configured — script uses its own defaults)
WT_DIR_FLAG=""
if [ -n "$WORKTREE_DIR" ]; then
  WT_DIR_FLAG="--worktree-dir ${WORKTREE_DIR}"
fi

# Resolve --hooks-json to pass custom setup hooks from config
HOOKS_FLAG=""
if [ "$SETUP_HOOKS" != "[]" ] && [ -n "$SETUP_HOOKS" ]; then
  HOOKS_FLAG="--hooks-json '${SETUP_HOOKS}'"
fi

# Pass --orchestration so all worktrees record which run they belong to
ORCH_FLAG="--orchestration ${ORCH_NAME}"

# 1. Create orchestrator worktree (same script, same initialization)
"$SCRIPT" "${ORCH_NAME}" "${BASE_BRANCH}" ${WT_DIR_FLAG} ${HOOKS_FLAG} ${ORCH_FLAG}
ORCH_WORKTREE="${WORKTREES_BASE}/${ORCH_NAME}"

# Per-orchestrator state lives under ~/catalyst/runs/<id>/ (decoupled from the
# git worktree — CTL-59). state.json, DASHBOARD.md, workers/, wave briefings,
# and SUMMARY.md all live here. Claude CLI output (streams/stderr) lands in
# workers/output/ so it sits alongside the signal files but does not pollute
# watchers that scan workers/*.json.
ORCH_DIR="$("${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/catalyst-state.sh" ensure-run-dir "${ORCH_NAME}")"

# 2. Create worker worktrees for current wave
for TICKET_ID in "${WAVE_TICKETS[@]}"; do
  "$SCRIPT" "${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET_ID}" "${BASE_BRANCH}" ${WT_DIR_FLAG} ${HOOKS_FLAG} ${ORCH_FLAG}
done
```

**Where worktrees actually land** — the `create-worktree.sh` script resolves the base directory in
this priority order:

1. `--worktree-dir <path>` flag (from `catalyst.orchestration.worktreeDir` config)
2. `~/catalyst/wt/<projectKey>/` (default — reads `catalyst.projectKey` from config)
3. `~/catalyst/wt/<repo>/` (fallback if no config)

So for a project with `projectKey: "acme"` and no `worktreeDir` override, all worktrees land in:

```
~/catalyst/wt/acme/
├── api-redesign/                         # orchestrator
├── api-redesign-ACME-101/                # worker
├── api-redesign-ACME-102/                # worker
└── api-redesign-ACME-103/                # worker
```

With `worktreeDir: "~/catalyst/api"` explicitly configured:

```
~/catalyst/api/
├── api-redesign/                         # orchestrator
├── api-redesign-ACME-101/                # worker
├── api-redesign-ACME-102/                # worker
└── api-redesign-ACME-103/                # worker
```

**Recommended**: Add `~/catalyst` to Claude Code's `additionalDirectories` in
`~/.claude/settings.json` so all worktrees across projects are automatically trusted:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "additionalDirectories": ["/Users/you/catalyst"]
  }
}
```

**What `create-worktree.sh` does for EACH worktree** (orchestrator and workers alike):

1. `git worktree add -b <name> <path> <base-branch>` — creates the worktree
2. Copies `.claude/` directory (Claude Code native config, plugins, rules)
3. Copies `.catalyst/` directory (Catalyst workflow config, if it exists)
4. **Runs `catalyst.worktree.setup` commands from config** — dependency install, thoughts init,
   permission grants, or any project-specific setup (like a worktree-manager's lifecycle
   hooks)
5. If no `catalyst.worktree.setup` configured, falls back to auto-detected setup: `make setup` or
   `bun/npm install`, then `humanlayer thoughts init` + `sync`
6. Runs additional orchestration hooks from `--hooks-json` (from
   `catalyst.orchestration.hooks.setup`)

**Available variables in setup commands:** `${WORKTREE_PATH}`, `${BRANCH_NAME}`, `${TICKET_ID}`,
`${REPO_NAME}`, `${DIRECTORY}`, `${PROFILE}`

**After worktree creation, set up the orchestrator's status directory:**

```bash
# ORCH_DIR is the per-orchestrator state dir under ~/catalyst/runs/<id>/ (created
# by `catalyst-state.sh ensure-run-dir` above, which already makes workers/output/).
# This mkdir is a no-op for fresh runs but keeps the skill robust when ORCH_DIR
# is reconstructed on resume.
mkdir -p "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/output"
```

Render the initial `DASHBOARD.md` (CTL-230) — the renderer reads `state.json` + `workers/*.json`
signals + the events log every cycle, so calling it now produces a real header + empty worker
table + waves outline rather than a template skeleton:

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/update-dashboard.sh" \
  --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" --roll-usage \
  >/dev/null 2>>"${ORCH_DIR}/.update-dashboard.log" || true
```

`--roll-usage` is the wire that fulfils the "Worker usage / cost is rolled in by the monitor pass"
contract below (CTL-487): the dashboard helper iterates `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json` and invokes
`orchestrate-roll-usage.sh -v` per worker before rendering, with stderr captured to
`${ORCH_DIR}/.roll-usage.log`. The per-worker call is bounded — already-rolled workers short-circuit
on `signal.cost != null` and cost a single `jq` read.

Create the orchestrator's status directory:

```
${ORCH_DIR}/                                    # ~/catalyst/runs/${ORCH_NAME}/
├── DASHBOARD.md                                # human-readable status (re-rendered each Phase 4 cycle)
├── state.json                                  # machine-readable orchestration state
├── wave-1-briefing.md                          # per-wave briefings
├── SUMMARY.md                                  # final run summary (post-Phase 5)
└── workers/
    ├── ${TICKET_1}.json                        # worker signal (schema: worker-signal.json)
    ├── ${TICKET_2}.json
    └── output/                                 # claude CLI output (streams, stderr)
        ├── ${TICKET_1}-stream.jsonl            # streaming JSON events from claude
        ├── ${TICKET_1}-stderr.log              # worker stderr (silent exits diagnosable)
        ├── ${TICKET_2}-stream.jsonl
        └── ${TICKET_2}-stderr.log
```

**Note on the runs/ split (CTL-59):** `ORCH_DIR` lives at `~/catalyst/runs/${ORCH_NAME}/` and is
decoupled from the git worktree at `${ORCH_WORKTREE}` (e.g.
`~/catalyst/wt/${PROJECT_KEY}/${ORCH_NAME}/`). This lets state survive worktree cleanup and keeps
`git status` clean. Claude CLI output (stream + stderr) lands in `workers/output/` to keep file
watchers that scan `workers/*.json` free of noise from large stream files.

**Debugging silent worker exits:** If `workers/output/${TICKET_ID}-stream.jsonl` is 0 bytes AND
`workers/output/${TICKET_ID}-stderr.log` is 0 bytes, the worker exited before emitting its first
event — check `git -C ${WORKER_DIR} log --oneline -5` and the worktree's `.claude/` directory for
setup issues. A non-empty stderr log will identify permission, path, or environment errors.

Initialize `state.json`:

```json
{
  "orchestrator": "<name>",
  "startedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "totalTickets": 6,
  "totalWaves": 3,
  "currentWave": 1,
  "worktreeBase": "<path>",
  "waves": [
    {
      "wave": 1,
      "status": "provisioning",
      "tickets": ["PROJ-101", "PROJ-102", "PROJ-103"]
    },
    {
      "wave": 2,
      "status": "blocked",
      "tickets": ["PROJ-104", "PROJ-105"],
      "dependsOn": [1]
    }
  ],
  "workers": {}
}
```

**Register with global state** (immediately after local state initialization):

```

The `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID` is set to `${ORCH_NAME}` for use by workers (passed via environment
variable alongside `CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR`).

**Capture event-log baseline (CTL-491):** Before any worker dispatch, snapshot the catalyst event
log's current line count and file path. The Phase 4 replay step uses this to find any
`phase.*.{complete,failed,turn-cap-exhausted,skipped}.<TICKET>` events that landed during the
dispatch-to-monitor handoff. The new `state.json.race` object is opaque to older state.json
consumers (they ignore unknown top-level fields via `.field // default` jq patterns).

```bash
EVENTS_DIR="${CATALYST_DIR:-$HOME/catalyst}/events"
mkdir -p "$EVENTS_DIR"
BASELINE_FILE="${EVENTS_DIR}/$(date -u +%Y-%m).jsonl"
[[ -f "$BASELINE_FILE" ]] || : > "$BASELINE_FILE"
BASELINE_LINE=$(wc -l < "$BASELINE_FILE" | tr -d ' ')
TMP="${ORCH_DIR}/state.json.tmp.$$"
jq --arg cursor "$BASELINE_LINE" --arg file "$BASELINE_FILE" --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
   '.race = {startLineCursor: ($cursor | tonumber), startEventsFile: $file, capturedAt: $ts}' \
   "${ORCH_DIR}/state.json" > "$TMP" \
   && mv "$TMP" "${ORCH_DIR}/state.json" || rm -f "$TMP"
```

**Create the shared comms channel (CTL-111):** the orchestrator creates a file-based channel that
every worker will auto-join via `CATALYST_COMMS_CHANNEL` in its dispatch env. Best-effort — the
orchestrator does not crash if `catalyst-comms` is missing.

```bash
# Shared channel for this run. Workers will join at dispatch time.
if [ -n "$COMMS_BIN" ]; then
  "$COMMS_BIN" join "${ORCH_NAME}" \
    --as orchestrator \
    --capabilities "coordinates workers" \
    --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" \
    --ttl 7200 >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

**Start session tracking** (alongside the global state registration above):

```bash
SESSION_SCRIPT="${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/catalyst-session.sh"
ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT="${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-status.sh"
if [[ -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  CATALYST_SESSION_ID=$("$SESSION_SCRIPT" start --skill "orchestrate" \
    --label "${ORCH_NAME}" \
    --workflow "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}")
  export CATALYST_SESSION_ID
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" phase "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" "dispatching" --phase 3
fi
```

### execution-core dispatch fork (CTL-554, CTL-582)

`dispatchMode: "execution-core"` and the `--stop` flag both short-circuit the wave loop. Evaluate
this **before Phase 3** — when it applies, no workers are dispatched and no Phase 4 monitor session
starts.

CTL-582 (D4) made the central registry `~/catalyst/execution-core/registry.json` the single source
of enrolled projects, maintained by `setup-execution-core-states.sh`. `/orchestrate` no longer
writes per-project enrollment records — there is nothing to enroll here.

- **Invoked with `--stop`** — execution-core projects are deregistered by editing the central
  registry, not by `/orchestrate`. Print the guidance and exit 0:

  ```bash
  echo "execution-core: enrolled projects are the central registry" \
    "~/catalyst/execution-core/registry.json — remove the team's entry there to deregister."
  # Exit 0 — do not continue.
  ```

- **`DISPATCH_MODE` is `execution-core` (no `--stop`)** — ensure the machine-level daemon is
  running, then exit:

  ```bash
  "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-execution-core-route.sh"
  # Ensures the daemon is running. No enrollment, no wave loop, no Phase 4
  # session. Exit 0 — do not continue to Phase 3.
  ```

- **Any other `DISPATCH_MODE`** — continue to Phase 3 below.

### Phase 3: Dispatch Workers

For each provisioned worker worktree, dispatch a `/oneshot` session.

**Register broker filter interests BEFORE dispatch (CTL-491):** Phase-agent workers can finish in
well under a second when their work is a no-op (e.g. an already-triaged ticket). Emitting
`filter.register` events AFTER dispatch opens a race window where the broker's interest map is still
empty when `phase.<name>.complete.<TICKET>` arrives — `processEvent` early-returns and the event is
dropped silently (`broker/index.mjs:1782`). Run the registration helper here so all four
deterministic + per-ticket interests are durable in the broker BEFORE any `claude --bg` invocation.
Idempotent at the broker (upserts by `interest_id`); the Phase 4 entry re-invokes the same helper as
a belt-and-suspenders.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-register-interests.sh" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --config "${REPO_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)}/.catalyst/config.json"
# Soft-fail-safe: helper exits 0 when broker/filter daemon is down (no-op) and
# 2 only on argument errors. See plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-register-interests.sh.
```

**Emit dispatching status (CTL-405):** Before launching workers, announce the phase:

```bash
TOTAL_WORKERS=$(jq -r '.progress.totalTickets // 0' "${ORCH_DIR}/state.json" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[[ -x "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" ]] && "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" emit \
  --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --phase dispatching --wave "${CURRENT_WAVE:-1}" \
  --total "$TOTAL_WORKERS" \
  --summary "wave ${CURRENT_WAVE:-1} dispatching" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Preferred entrypoint — `orchestrate-dispatch-next` (CTL-116):**

The canonical dispatcher drains `state.json`'s `.queue.waveNPending` for every `N` (dynamically, so
wave 1/2/3/…/N all work without code changes), respects `maxParallel - currentlyRunning`, writes
dispatched/phase-0 signal files, launches workers via `nohup`, updates global state, removes
dispatched tickets from whichever `waveNPending` list they lived in, and runs the post-dispatch
healthcheck:

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-dispatch-next" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --config "${REPO_ROOT}/.catalyst/config.json"
# Emits a one-line JSON summary: {"running":R,"slotsAfter":S,"dispatched":[...][,"queueEmpty":true]}
# Reads `orchestrator`, `worktreeBase`, `maxParallel` from state.json by default.
# Pass --session-id / --worker-command / --worker-args / --comms-channel to override.
# Pass --dry-run to preview without writing state or launching claude.
#
# CTL-452: --config gates the dispatch mode. With dispatchMode = "phase-agents",
# the dispatcher launches phase-triage agents on `claude --bg` (subscription pool)
# via `phase-agent-dispatch`, and the wake handler in this Phase 4 advances each
# worker through this script's 9-phase sequence (triage..monitor-deploy; this
# legacy wake table does not dispatch teardown). With dispatchMode = "oneshot-legacy" or
# no --config, the dispatcher uses the legacy `-p oneshot` worker (one long
# claude session per ticket). Phase advancement calls always pass explicit
# `--phase <name> --ticket <T>` and bypass the dispatchMode default.
```

Call this once when the current wave is ready to dispatch, and again whenever a worker slot frees
up. It supersedes the hand-rolled `dispatch-next.sh` pattern from pre-CTL-116 orchestration runs
(which hardcoded `wave1Pending + wave2Pending + wave3Pending`). The inline block below is preserved
as reference for the underlying machinery.

**Phase advancement on `phase.<name>.complete.<TICKET>` wake (CTL-452):**

```bash
# Inside the wake handler — called once per phase-complete event surfaced
# via the broker's phase_lifecycle interest.
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-phase-advance" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --ticket "${TICKET}" \
  --completed-phase "${COMPLETED_PHASE}"
# Emits one-line JSON: {"advanced": true|false, "fromPhase": "<name>", "toPhase": "<next>|null", ...}
# The helper resolves the next phase via this script's own 9-phase sequence
# (triage..monitor-deploy — this legacy wake table does not dispatch teardown),
# refuses to double-dispatch (idempotent), and delegates to dispatch-next
# with --phase <next> --ticket <T>. If `completed-phase = monitor-deploy`,
# the ticket has reached the terminal phase and no further advance happens.
```

**Phase failure on `phase.<name>.failed.<TICKET>` wake (CTL-452):**

```bash
# Run orchestrate-revive once. The script already implements the
# one-retry-then-escalate policy via .reviveCount + --max-revives, and
# CTL-452 added the --bg --resume path for phase-mode workers (legacy
# oneshot workers continue to use -p --resume — backward compatible).
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-revive" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}"
# On the second consecutive failure (reviveCount ≥ MAX_REVIVES), revive
# marks the worker stalled, sets attentionReason = "revive-budget-exhausted",
# and emits attention via catalyst-state — matching the existing escalation
# pattern for legacy workers.
```

**Phase turn-cap exhaustion on `phase.<name>.turn-cap-exhausted.<TICKET>` wake (CTL-484):**

```bash
# Same script — orchestrate-revive's continuation branch (CTL-484) detects
# status=turn-cap-exhausted on the top-level signal + handoffPath on the
# per-phase signal (written by phase-agent-emit-complete --handoff-path),
# dispatches a continuation worker with CATALYST_IS_CONTINUATION=true +
# CATALYST_HANDOFF_PATH=<path> + CATALYST_CONTINUATION_COUNT=<n>, and bumps
# .continuationCount on a budget separate from .reviveCount (default 3 vs 10).
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-revive" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}"
# On budget exhaustion (continuationCount ≥ MAX_CONTINUATIONS), revive marks
# the worker stalled with attentionReason = "continuation-budget-exhausted"
# and emits worker-continuation-budget-exhausted. The separate budget is what
# stops cap-exhaustion runs from burning the error-revive budget — that was
# the bug CTL-484 fixes.
```

**Dispatch mechanism — `claude` CLI with streaming JSON:**

```bash
WORKER_DIR="${WORKTREES_BASE}/${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET_ID}"
WORKER_STREAM="${ORCH_DIR}/workers/output/${TICKET_ID}-stream.jsonl"
WORKER_STDERR="${ORCH_DIR}/workers/output/${TICKET_ID}-stderr.log"
SIGNAL_FILE="${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET_ID}.json"

# `claude -w` takes a *name* and creates a new worktree — it does NOT accept a
# path to an existing worktree. The worker worktree was already provisioned in
# Phase 2, so `cd` into it inside a backgrounded subshell and `exec` claude so
# its PID is reachable from the outer shell as `$!`.
# `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is required because headless workers have no
# TTY to answer permission prompts; the worktree is pre-trusted via Catalyst's
# setup hooks. `nohup` keeps the worker alive after the orchestrator shell
# exits. Stderr goes to a real file (not /dev/null) so a silent worker exit
# stays debuggable.
(
  cd "${WORKER_DIR}" || exit 1
  CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR="${ORCH_DIR}" \
  CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_ID="${ORCH_NAME}" \
  CATALYST_COMMS_CHANNEL="${ORCH_NAME}" \
  CATALYST_SESSION_ID="${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" \
  exec nohup claude \
    -n "${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET_ID}" \
    --output-format stream-json \
    --verbose \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    -p "${WORKER_COMMAND} ${TICKET_ID} --auto-merge"
) > "$WORKER_STREAM" 2> "$WORKER_STDERR" &

WORKER_PID=$!

# Record the worker's PID + initial heartbeat into its signal file so the
# monitor can perform kill-0 liveness checks.
if [ -f "$SIGNAL_FILE" ]; then
  jq --argjson pid "$WORKER_PID" '.pid = $pid | .lastHeartbeat = .updatedAt' \
    "$SIGNAL_FILE" > "${SIGNAL_FILE}.tmp" && mv "${SIGNAL_FILE}.tmp" "$SIGNAL_FILE"
fi
```

**Streaming JSON output** (`--output-format stream-json --verbose`) emits NDJSON to stdout, one
event per line, in real-time as the worker runs. The monitor can tail the stream file to show live
worker activity. Key event types:

| Event                                                                                                             | What it signals                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{"type":"system","subtype":"init"}`                                                                              | Worker session started; contains `session_id`                   |
| `{"type":"stream_event","event":{"type":"content_block_start","content_block":{"type":"tool_use","name":"..."}}}` | Worker is now invoking a specific tool (Bash, Read, Edit, etc.) |
| `{"type":"stream_event","event":{"type":"content_block_delta","delta":{"type":"text_delta"}}}`                    | Worker is generating reasoning/response text                    |
| `{"type":"assistant"}`                                                                                            | Complete assistant turn with all content blocks                 |
| `{"type":"system","subtype":"api_retry"}`                                                                         | Worker hit rate limit / error; shows attempt and delay          |
| `{"type":"result"}`                                                                                               | Worker finished; contains final answer and usage stats          |

**Worker usage / cost is rolled in by the monitor pass (CTL-115, wired through
`update-dashboard.sh --roll-usage` since CTL-487).** The dispatch shell backgrounds workers with `&`
and never `wait`s on them, so usage/cost extraction cannot happen here. Phase 4's
`update-dashboard.sh` call passes `--roll-usage`, which iterates `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json` and
invokes `plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-roll-usage.sh -v` per worker before rendering. The helper
parses the final `result` event from the worker's stream file and:

1. Mirror cost into the worker's signal file (`.cost = USAGE`) — the dashboard reads signal files
   (not global state) for per-worker cost columns.
2. Write `state.workers[ticket].usage`.
3. Roll the delta into `state.usage` for the orchestrator-level aggregate.

The helper is idempotent (gated on `signal.cost == null`) and safe to call every cycle. Because
every dashboard render now sweeps every worker, `update-dashboard.sh --roll-usage` doubles as the
periodic safety net for any worker whose stream contains a `result` event but whose `signal.cost` is
still null. Audit trail lands at `${ORCH_DIR}/.roll-usage.log`.

**Emit dispatch event and update global state** after each worker dispatch:

```bash
"$STATE_SCRIPT" worker "${ORCH_NAME}" "${TICKET_ID}" '.status = "dispatched" | .phase = 0'
"$STATE_SCRIPT" update "${ORCH_NAME}" '.progress.inProgressTickets += 1'
"$STATE_SCRIPT" event "$(jq -nc \
  --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --arg w "${TICKET_ID}" \
  '{ts: $ts, orchestrator: $orch, worker: $w, event: "worker-dispatched", detail: null}')"
```

**Post-dispatch health check (CTL-87):**

After the wave's per-worker dispatch loop has completed, run the batch health check. This is the
**per-wave** invocation (CTL-511 added a second call site — see the reactive scan in Phase 4). It
sleeps briefly (default 15s — configurable via `--grace-seconds`), then verifies that every worker
still sitting at `status="dispatched"`/`phase=0` has a live PID. Any worker whose PID has already
died is transitioned to `status="failed"` with `failureReason="launch-failure"`, an attention item
of type `launch-failure` is raised, and a `worker-launch-failed` event is emitted. This means
dead-on-arrival workers surface in under 30 seconds instead of after the 15-minute stalled-worker
timeout, and the orchestrator can re-dispatch them (via `orchestrate-fixup` or a manual redispatch)
in the same wave.

```bash
# Run ONCE, after all workers in this wave have been dispatched.
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-healthcheck" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}"
# Prints a JSON summary on stdout: {"checked":N,"dead":M,"deadTickets":[...]}.
# Launch failures also appear in the attention list and as `worker-launch-failed`
# events in the global state log.
```

Healthy workers are untouched. Workers that have already advanced past `dispatched` (e.g. into
`researching`) are skipped because reaching a later status is itself proof of life. This check
complements the 15-minute stalled-worker detection in Phase 4 — healthcheck catches launch failures,
the stalled-worker scan catches workers that die mid-run.

**CTL-511:** the same `orchestrate-healthcheck` script also runs inside the reactive scan (Phase 4)
on every wake-up and every 10-minute idle tick — it is no longer a once-per-wave-only check. That
second call site catches phase agents that die _after_ launch (printing a job id, then exiting
before their terminal emit), bounding detection to one scan interval. The healthcheck is idempotent
— terminal and `stalled` signals are skipped — so the extra call site adds no duplicate work.

**Worker dispatch prompt includes mandatory testing AND lifecycle requirements:**

```
MANDATORY: Before completing your contract:
1. TDD — write failing tests BEFORE implementation for every feature
2. Unit tests — required for all new functions/methods
3. Integration/API tests — required for every new/modified API endpoint
4. Security review — must pass /security-review or equivalent
5. Code review — must pass code-reviewer agent
6. All quality gates in config must pass

Your success contract ENDS at (CTL-252):
  ✓ PR open (gh pr create succeeded)
  ✓ Active listen loop resolved all blockers (CI, bot reviews, BEHIND) inline
  ✓ PR merged with gh pr merge --squash (worktree-safe, CTL-56; no --auto; remote ref deleted via gh api --method DELETE after REST confirm)
  ✓ Optional deployment verified (if catalyst.deploy configured)
  ✓ pr.mergedAt, deployment.url (if applicable), status="done" written to signal file
  ✓ Worker process exits cleanly

Listen for PR events using this precedence ladder (matches oneshot Phase 5):

  1. PREFERRED — Broker auto-correlation (Pattern 3, lowest cost):
     The catalyst-broker daemon classifies events between Claude turns and
     emits filter.wake.${CATALYST_SESSION_ID} only on semantic matches.
     The agent.checkin event emitted by catalyst-session.sh start already
     identifies you to the broker; emit a second agent.checkin carrying
     claimed_pr after gh pr create (the oneshot helper broker_claim_pr does
     exactly this). The broker auto-derives a pr_lifecycle interest covering
     CI, reviews, comments, thread resolution, merge, BEHIND pushes, and
     deployment status — all on a single wake event. Wait on:
       catalyst-events wait-for \
         --filter ".attributes.\"event.name\" == \"filter.wake.${CATALYST_SESSION_ID}\"" \
         --timeout 600
     Deterministic routes (pr_lifecycle / ticket_lifecycle / comms_lifecycle)
     cost zero LLM tokens. See plugins/dev/skills/broker/SKILL.md for the
     full protocol and plugins/dev/skills/catalyst-filter/SKILL.md for
     prose-based registration when the deterministic routes aren't enough.

  2. FALLBACK — catalyst-events wait-for with explicit jq (Pattern 2):
     When catalyst-broker status returns non-running, use the two-phase
     pattern from plugins/dev/skills/wait-for-github/SKILL.md. Blocking
     subprocess call; works reliably in claude -p non-interactive sessions.
     One jq predicate covers CI / reviews / push / merge for your PR.

  3. FORBIDDEN for workers — Monitor over catalyst-events tail (Pattern 1):
     That is the orchestrator's Phase 4 pattern, not a worker pattern.
     A short-lived claude -p worker has no long-lived turn loop to consume
     Monitor notifications, and tail filters wake on every matching line,
     burning context.

NEVER use gh pr view --json in any loop — that burns GraphQL rate limits.
Use gh api REST endpoints only for the authoritative state check that
follows every wake.

WAKE NARRATION (MANDATORY, CTL-369): every Monitor wake and every wait-for
return must be acknowledged with a single short line of assistant text before
returning to the wait. A thinking-only end_turn after a Monitor wake makes the
harness's next <task-notification> XML leak as a confusing "Human:\n<task-id>"
phantom user message. The line shape is:

  wake: <event.name> #<pr> [interest=<type>] — <action being taken>
  wake: <event.name> — routine, staying in event loop
  wake: <event.name> — already addressed, no-op

Include the matched filter clause / interest_id when the wake is from the
broker (.body.payload.interest_id, .body.payload.reason). See
plugins/dev/skills/monitor-events/SKILL.md § Narration for the full rule.

When you write a filter by hand, target the canonical event names listed in
[[event-name-allowlist]] — anything outside that allowlist is either
non-actionable or covered by a different lifecycle group. Do NOT use
`.attributes."catalyst.orchestrator.id"` as a bare clause: CTL-234 stamps it
on every github webhook tied to one of the orchestrator's PRs, so without an
event-type guard it wakes the worker on 60-70% of unrelated webhooks. See
[[wait-for-github]] § Known filter pitfalls.

Write these fields into your signal file as they become available:
  pr.number
  pr.url
  pr.prOpenedAt       (ISO timestamp when gh pr create returned)
  pr.mergedAt         (ISO timestamp when merge confirmed via REST)
  pr.mergeCommitSha   (from REST response after merge)
  pr.ciStatus         (pending → merged)
  deployment.url      (from deployment_status event, if configured)
  status              (pr-created → done)

On unrecoverable blockers (human changes-requested, DIRTY after attempts,
CI blocked after 3 fix attempts), write status="stalled" with details and
post a `comms attention` message — the orchestrator's Phase 4 dispatches
remediation for stalled workers.

Status transitions you do NOT write (orchestrator-owned fallback only):
  done   (written by orchestrator Phase 4 ONLY when worker stalled before merge)

COMMS DISCIPLINE: when posting to the shared comms channel, follow the rules in the
catalyst-comms skill (plugins/dev/skills/catalyst-comms/SKILL.md § Posting Discipline):
  - info = phase transitions + PR-opened only (default heartbeat, ~5-7 per session)
  - attention = orchestrator action required (0-2 per session, MANDATORY on: scope
    conflict, missing access, ambiguous spec, 3+ repeated CI failures, status=stalled)
  - done = exactly 1, only via the `done` subcommand at terminal success
  - never use attention as a heartbeat — it triggers the orchestrator's NEEDS ATTENTION
    banner

Write your status to the worker signal file at:
  ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET_ID}.json

Update the signal file at each phase transition using the worker-signal.json schema.
```

**Initialize worker signal file** (orchestrator writes the initial state):

```json
{
  "ticket": "PROJ-101",
  "orchestrator": "<name>",
  "workerName": "<orch-name>-PROJ-101",
  "label": "oneshot PROJ-101",

### Phase 4: Monitor & Track

```bash
if [[ -n "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" && -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" phase "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" "monitoring" --phase 4
fi
ACTIVE_COUNT=$(jq -rs '[.[] | select(.status != "done" and .status != "failed")] | length' \
  "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/"*.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
TOTAL_COUNT=$(jq -rs 'length' "${ORCH_DIR}/workers/"*.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[[ -x "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" ]] && "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" emit \
  --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --phase monitoring --wave "${CURRENT_WAVE:-1}" \
  --active "$ACTIVE_COUNT" --total "$TOTAL_COUNT" \
  --summary "wave ${CURRENT_WAVE:-1} monitoring (${ACTIVE_COUNT}/${TOTAL_COUNT} active)" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Re-register with catalyst-broker daemon (CTL-257, CTL-303, CTL-357, CTL-452, CTL-491):** Phase 3
already invoked `orchestrate-register-interests.sh` BEFORE worker dispatch (the CTL-491 race-fix
hoist). This Phase 4 entry calls the same helper again as a belt-and-suspenders — registration is
idempotent at the broker (upserts by `interest_id`), and a second invocation ensures the four
interests stay fresh even if the broker restarted between Phase 3 and Phase 4.

The helper emits four deterministic interests (route without Groq):

- `pr_lifecycle` — orchestrator-level aggregation across all worker PRs.
- `ticket_lifecycle` — Linear ticket state changes for the orchestrator's tickets.
- `comms_lifecycle` — worker-posted `attention` / `done` messages on the shared channel.
- `phase_lifecycle` (CTL-452, CTL-484, CTL-512) — `phase.<name>.complete.<TICKET>`,
  `phase.<name>.failed.<TICKET>`, `phase.<name>.turn-cap-exhausted.<TICKET>`, and
  `phase.<name>.skipped.<TICKET>` events emitted by phase agents. One interest per active ticket,
  covering all 9 phase names (triage..monitor-deploy — this legacy interest set does not include
  teardown). The turn-cap status routes through `orchestrate-revive`'s continuation
  branch (separate budget from error revives). The skipped status (CTL-512, monitor-deploy
  terminal-no-deploy) routes the same as complete via `orchestrate-phase-advance` — advance no-ops
  on monitor-deploy, so the wake's purpose is to free the wave slot via the scheduler's in-flight
  predicate. Only registered when `catalyst.orchestration.dispatchMode = "phase-agents"`.

CTL-357 retired the Groq prose interest (~95% false-positive rate). All four interests share the
same `notify_event: "filter.wake.${ORCH_NAME}"`, so the orchestrator's `wait-for` filter does not
change.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-register-interests.sh" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --config "${REPO_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)}/.catalyst/config.json"
# Helper internals: see plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-register-interests.sh
# for the exact wire format of each filter.register event. Soft-fails (exit 0)
# when neither catalyst-broker nor catalyst-filter is running.
```

**Replay race-window phase events (CTL-491):** Before entering the event-driven wait loop, catch up
on any `phase.<name>.{complete,failed,turn-cap-exhausted,skipped}.<TICKET>` events that landed
between the Phase 2 baseline (`state.json.race.startLineCursor`) and now. With the Phase 3
pre-dispatch registration the window should be zero-length in steady state, but the replay is
idempotent and cheap — it scans only the tail of the current month's event log past the baseline
cursor and routes each match through `orchestrate-phase-advance` (for `complete` / `skipped`) or
`orchestrate-revive` (for `failed` / `turn-cap-exhausted`). Cross-orchestrator events are filtered out by checking
`workers/*.json` for the ticket.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-replay-phase-events.sh" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" || true
# Soft-fail with || true so a malformed event log or missing baseline can't
# stall the orchestrator; the live Monitor/wait-for path picks up new events
# regardless. The helper exits 1 only when state.json.race is missing.
```

**Phase 4 is event-driven, not poll-driven (CTL-210, CTL-243).** The orchestrator subscribes to the
unified event log via `catalyst-events tail` (wrapped in the `Monitor` tool) and wakes on every
relevant GitHub / Linear / orchestrator-lifecycle event. A 10-minute idle timer is the **safety-net
fallback** for daemon-down or missed-event scenarios — never the primary mechanism. Do NOT self-pace
with sleeps or "wake in N minutes" framing — that defeats the event-driven contract and burns
context to no purpose. See `plugins/dev/skills/monitor-events/SKILL.md` for the full pattern.

**Launch the Monitor before entering the reactive scan.** Wrap this command with the `Monitor` tool
— each emitted line is a wake-up.

The recommended filter is **scope-aware**: build it from the orchestrator's worker signal directory
using `catalyst-events build-orchestrator-filter`, then pass the result verbatim as `--filter`:

```text
FILTER=$(catalyst-events build-orchestrator-filter "$ORCH_DIR")
catalyst-events tail --filter "$FILTER"
```

Use this command EXACTLY as shown — do NOT improvise a `| grep …` or `| jq …` post-pipe (see "Filter
discipline" below for why, including the specific `| grep -v 'filter.wake'` anti-pattern).

**catalyst-filter alternative (CTL-257):** When the filter daemon is running, you can replace the
broad `catalyst-events tail` with a targeted `catalyst-events wait-for` on
`filter.wake.{ORCH_NAME}`. The daemon batches raw events through Groq, classifies which are relevant
to this orchestrator's context, and emits a single wake event — so the reactive scan runs only on
semantically meaningful events rather than on every raw webhook. The 10-minute timeout acts as the
safety-net fallback for daemon-down scenarios.

```bash
WAKE_EVENT=$(catalyst-events wait-for \
  --filter ".attributes.\"event.name\" == \"filter.wake.${ORCH_NAME}\"" \
  --timeout 600 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -n "$WAKE_EVENT" ]; then
  WAKE_REASON=$(echo "$WAKE_EVENT" | jq -r '.body.payload.reason // "unknown"' 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
  echo "[Phase 4] Filter wake: ${WAKE_REASON}"
fi
# Always follow with an authoritative REST re-check — the reason string is informational only.
```

Use `WAKE_REASON` for logging only; the reactive scan below reads authoritative state from
`gh pr view`, `git rev-list`, and the signal file regardless of how the wake was triggered.

The helper reads `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json` and emits a single jq predicate that matches
catalyst-origin events for this orchestrator, worker lifecycle events for any in-orch ticket, github
events scoped by branch-ref prefix (`refs/heads/<orch>-...`) or PR-number set,
`check_suite`/`workflow_run` events whose `detail.prNumbers` intersect the PR set, and linear events
for any in-orch ticket. Re-build it after `orchestrate-dispatch-next` adds new workers so the
PR/ticket sets stay in sync.

**Filter discipline (CTL-240, CTL-372).** All noise filtering belongs **inside** `--filter`. Do NOT
pipe `catalyst-events tail` through a downstream `awk`/`sed`/`grep`/`jq` stage for additional
filtering or projection. The primary reason is clarity — `--filter` is the single place a reader can
look to see what reaches the consumer. The secondary reason is buffering: BSD `awk` (and unflagged
`grep`/`sed`) buffer stdout in 4 KB blocks when stdout is not a TTY, and with the typical ~1–3
events/min orchestrator cadence the buffer never fills and notifications stall silently for 15+
minutes despite live PR activity. `grep --line-buffered` and `jq --unbuffered` DO line-flush
mechanically (per their macOS/Linux man pages), but you should still not need either flag because
filtering belongs in `--filter`.

**Anti-pattern (CTL-372):** `… | grep -v '"event.name":"filter.wake"'`. Observed in a real
orchestrator session and is wrong for two reasons: (a) `filter.wake.*` events are emitted by the
broker as canonical OTel envelopes with no top-level `.event`, `.orchestrator`, or `.scope` field.
`build-orchestrator-filter`'s predicate reads only v1 paths, so canonical `filter.wake.*` events
never satisfy any clause and never reach the consumer in the first place. (b) The grep pattern would
also strip this orchestrator's OWN intended `filter.wake.${ORCH_NAME}` wake — the very event
registered with the broker. Since CTL-346 the broker no longer re-classifies its own emissions, so
there is no feedback loop to defend against on the consumer side either. If you find yourself
wanting to remove filter.wake noise from `tail` output, the answer is to use
`build-orchestrator-filter` (which already excludes them) and avoid any hand-rolled `--filter` that
adds a `.attributes."catalyst.orchestrator.id"` clause without an event-type guard.

**GitHub event schema (CTL-240).** `github.*` webhook events carry `orchestrator: null` and
`worker: null` on every line — they are scoped only by `.attributes."vcs.repository.name"`,
`.attributes."vcs.ref.name"`, `.attributes."vcs.pr.number"`, `.attributes."vcs.revision"`, and (for
`check_suite` / `workflow_run`) `body.payload.prNumbers`. Predicates that try to scope github events
by `.attributes."catalyst.orchestrator.id" == "<orch>"` will silently drop every github event.
`build-orchestrator-filter` handles this correctly — prefer it over hand-rolled filters.

If you need to write a filter by hand (e.g. for one-off `wait-for` calls), the broad event-type
recommendation is:

```text
catalyst-events tail --filter '
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.pr.")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.pr_review")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.issue_comment")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.check_")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.workflow_run")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("github.deployment")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "github.push") or
  (.attributes."event.name" | startswith("linear.issue.")) or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.worker.phase_advanced") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.worker.status_terminal") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.worker.pr_created") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.worker.done") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.worker.failed") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.attention.raised") or
  (.attributes."event.name" == "orchestrator.attention.resolved")
'
```

This list extends the pre-CTL-240 recommendation with `pr_review_comment` (Codex review threads land
here — needed for CTL-64 BLOCKED auto-fixup detection), `issue_comment` (general PR comments), and
`workflow_run` (the most reliable CI-done signal). The broad form has no scope filter, so events
from sibling orchestrators sharing the repo will also fire wake-ups; prefer
`build-orchestrator-filter` when you have an `$ORCH_DIR` to draw on.

**Wake narration (MANDATORY, CTL-369).** Every Monitor wake — including ones classified as routine
or already-addressed — must produce a single short line of assistant text before returning to the
wait. The Claude Code harness wraps each Monitor stdout line in a `<task-notification>` XML user
message; if the orchestrator's response is `end_turn` with only `thinking` blocks and no `text`
content, the UI renders the next `<task-notification>`'s `<task-id>` as a phantom
`Human:\n<task-id>` line in the transcript. The narration line defeats that artifact and gives the
operator reading the transcript later a record of what fired and what was decided.

Line shape (pick one; keep it under ~120 characters):

```text
wake: <event.name> #<pr> [interest=<type>] — <action being taken>
wake: <event.name> — routine, staying in event loop
wake: <event.name> — already addressed, no-op
wake: idle-timeout — running periodic reconciliation scan
```

Surface the matched interest when wake came from the broker (`filter.wake.${ORCH_NAME}`): include
`.body.payload.interest_id` (or its type: `pr_lifecycle` / `ticket_lifecycle` / `comms_lifecycle`)
and a one-clause restatement of `.body.payload.reason`. For broad-form `catalyst-events tail` wakes,
surface the raw `event.name` and the PR/ticket scope instead.

See `plugins/dev/skills/monitor-events/SKILL.md` § Narration for the full rule and the good-vs-bad
transcript fixture.

**Wake-up classification.** When a line arrives on the Monitor, classify it before re-entering the
scan so the response stays proportional. Every reaction reads authoritative state from `gh pr view`,
`git rev-list`, or the signal file — events are wake-up triggers, never sources of truth.

**Ground truth is git + PR, not the signal file.** The signal file is _advisory_ — it reports the
worker's self-described phase. Authoritative decisions (done, stalled) come from `gh pr view` /
`gh pr list --head <branch>` and `git rev-list --count <base>..<branch>`. A merged upstream PR on a
worker's branch means the worker is done, regardless of what the signal file says. A worker with a
live upstream PR is not stalled even if its signal file is stale. When the signal disagrees with
git/PR, the orchestrator reconciles the signal from the authoritative source.

**Reactive scan (per wake-up):**

```bash
# CTL-511: re-run the phase-agent stall scan on every reactive scan (every wake
# + the 10-min idle fallback), not just once per dispatch wave. A phase agent
# that dies after launch is flipped to status:"stalled" here; orchestrate-healthcheck
# then emits phase.<name>.failed to wake orchestrate-revive within one scan
# interval instead of ~14 h. Idempotent — terminal/stalled signals are skipped,
# so frequent runs are safe. --grace-seconds 0 skips the 15s legacy-PID settle
# sleep: the phase-mode state.json check has its own --stale-bg-seconds
# threshold, so the sleep would only add latency to every wake.

```

**Update `DASHBOARD.md` on each wake-up** using the dashboard template — every incoming event
re-renders the file. The orch-monitor daemon file-watches `DASHBOARD.md` and forwards changes to
connected UI clients via SSE, so per-event writes propagate to operators immediately. Include:

- Wave progress (current wave, tickets per wave)
- Per-worker status table (ticket, status, PR, test coverage columns)
- Event log (timestamped significant events)

**Update `state.json`** with machine-readable state for crash recovery.

**Update global state and heartbeat** after each wake-up:

```bash
# Heartbeat — proves the orchestrator is alive
"$STATE_SCRIPT" heartbeat "${ORCH_NAME}"

# Sync each worker's status from signal file to global state
for WORKER_SIGNAL in ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json; do
  TICKET=$(jq -r '.ticket' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")
  W_STATUS=$(jq -r '.status' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")
  W_PHASE=$(jq -r '.phase' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")
  W_BRANCH=$(git -C "${WORKTREE_BASE}/${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET}" branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  W_PR=$(jq -c '.pr // null' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")

  "$STATE_SCRIPT" worker "${ORCH_NAME}" "${TICKET}" \
    ".status = \"${W_STATUS}\" | .phase = ${W_PHASE} | .branch = \"${W_BRANCH}\" | .pr = ${W_PR}"
done

# Re-render DASHBOARD.md so the file artifact reflects current state (CTL-230).
# `--roll-usage` first iterates ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json and invokes
# orchestrate-roll-usage.sh -v per worker (CTL-115, CTL-233, CTL-487) — bounded
# and idempotent (no-op when signal.cost is already populated) and writes the
# audit trail to ${ORCH_DIR}/.roll-usage.log. Then renders the dashboard so the
# refreshed signal.cost values appear in the same pass. Same inputs produce a
# byte-identical file. The orch-monitor daemon file-watches DASHBOARD.md and
# forwards changes to UI clients via SSE.

```

**Merge confirmation fallback (CTL-31, refined by CTL-80, CTL-133, CTL-243, CTL-252):**

Workers now exit at `status: "done"` after actively merging their own PR (CTL-252). The
orchestrator's merge confirmation scan is a **safety-net fallback** for workers that stalled or
crashed before completing their own merge. Every Monitor wake-up triggered by `github.pr.merged`,
`github.pr.closed`, `github.push`, or `github.check_suite.completed` runs this scan, and the
10-minute idle fallback re-runs it so daemon-down windows do not block indefinitely. For each worker
whose signal shows `pr.number` but not yet `pr.mergedAt`, ping GitHub directly:

```bash
for WORKER_SIGNAL in ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json; do
  TICKET=$(jq -r '.ticket' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")

**Refresh broker registration when PR or ticket set has changed (CTL-341, CTL-357, CTL-491).** On
every Phase 4 wake-up, re-invoke the same registration helper with `--refresh`. The helper diffs the
current active PR + ticket sets against the prior `.last-registration.json` baseline:

- If nothing changed, the helper exits 0 with zero events emitted — keeps the event log quiet.
- If the PR set changed (a worker just opened a PR), it re-emits all three deterministic interests
  (`pr_lifecycle`, `ticket_lifecycle`, `comms_lifecycle`) with the updated set.
- If the ticket set grew (wave 2 dispatched new workers mid-run), it ALSO emits a `phase_lifecycle`
  interest for each newly-added ticket. Existing tickets already have per-ticket interests upserted
  at the broker from the initial pre-dispatch registration.
- Idempotent at the broker (upserts by `interest_id`); the diff just keeps the event log quiet.

This block replaces the older `.last-pr-registration.json` PR-only refresh path — the helper covers
both deterministic-set refreshes AND the previously-missing `phase_lifecycle` refresh that would
otherwise leave wave 2 tickets without broker coverage (a localized CTL-491 race).

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-register-interests.sh" \
  --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" \
  --orch-id "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --config "${REPO_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)}/.catalyst/config.json" \
  --refresh
# In --refresh mode the helper is a no-op when the PR + ticket sets are
# unchanged; otherwise it emits a minimal set of filter.register events to
# bring the broker in sync. See plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-register-interests.sh.
```

**Deploy state-machine sub-loop (CTL-211)** — runs on each wake-up for any worker in `merged` or
`deploying`. Wakes on `github.deployment*` events from the event log; otherwise the 10-minute
fallback sweep catches missed events. The authoritative source is `gh api repos/<repo>/deployments`
and `/deployments/<id>/statuses`. Events are wake-up triggers only.

```

The state-machine transition logic is mirrored in
`plugins/dev/scripts/orch-monitor/lib/deploy-state-machine.ts` as a pure function
(`nextDeployState`) so the transitions are mechanically verified by unit tests independently of this
bash glue.

Since CTL-252, workers exit at `status: "done"` after actively merging their own PR — this
orchestrator scan is a safety-net fallback that writes `pr.mergedAt` + `status: "done"` for workers
that stalled before completing their own merge.

**Drain shared comms channel for attention (CTL-111, CTL-269):**

Workers post `type:attention` messages to `${ORCH_NAME}` when blocked. On each wake-up, the
orchestrator drains new messages from the channel and promotes any `attention` to a state-level
attention item so the dashboard's NEEDS ATTENTION banner surfaces it (with author + reason).

The wake mechanism for comms attention is now **unified with the filter daemon** (CTL-269): when a
worker posts to comms, `catalyst-comms send` emits a `comms.message.posted` event to the unified
event log; the filter daemon matches it against the orchestrator's `filter.register` prompt (which
now mentions "any of my workers posts a comms message of type attention to me") and emits
`filter.wake.${ORCH_NAME}`. The orchestrator wakes from that single event and runs this drain step
to act on the attention.

A small cursor file `${ORCH_DIR}/.comms-cursor` tracks the line count already processed so repeated
wake-ups don't re-surface the same message. Single-writer (this scan) so no race. The cursor-based
drain remains the **action** mechanism even though wakes come via `filter.wake`.

```bash
if [ -n "$COMMS_BIN" ]; then
  CURSOR_FILE="${ORCH_DIR}/.comms-cursor"
  SINCE=$(cat "$CURSOR_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  CH_FILE="${HOME}/catalyst/comms/channels/${ORCH_NAME}.jsonl"
  TOTAL=$(wc -l < "$CH_FILE" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ' || echo 0)

  if [ "${TOTAL:-0}" -gt "${SINCE:-0}" ]; then
    # `poll` here is the catalyst-comms CLI subcommand name (read since cursor),
    # not a poll-loop metaphor — the orchestrator runs this on wake-up only.
    "$COMMS_BIN" poll "${ORCH_NAME}" --since "$SINCE" 2>/dev/null | \
    while IFS= read -r MSG; do
      MSG_TYPE=$(echo "$MSG" | jq -r '.type // ""' 2>/dev/null)

      if [ "$MSG_TYPE" = "attention" ]; then
        # Extract the ticket id from the author name (workers use their TICKET_ID as --as)
        MSG_TICKET=$(echo "$MSG_FROM" | grep -oE '^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' || echo "$MSG_FROM")

**Detect stalled workers and raise attention:**

Before raising `stalled`, consult git + PR state. A stale signal file is not stall evidence on its
own — if the worker's upstream branch has an OPEN or MERGED PR, the worker is progressing (or
finished) regardless of what the signal file says. Only escalate when no authoritative source shows
activity.

```bash
for WORKER_SIGNAL in ${ORCH_DIR}/workers/*.json; do
  TICKET=$(jq -r '.ticket' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")
  W_STATUS=$(jq -r '.status' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")
  UPDATED=$(jq -r '.updatedAt' "$WORKER_SIGNAL")

  # If no update in 15+ minutes and not in a terminal state, consider escalating.
  if [[ "$W_STATUS" != "done" && "$W_STATUS" != "failed" && "$W_STATUS" != "stalled" ]]; then
    STALE_CUTOFF=$(date -u -v-15M +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null \
      || date -u -d "15 minutes ago" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
    if [[ "$UPDATED" < "$STALE_CUTOFF" ]]; then
      # Before raising stalled, consult git + PR state. CTL-32: a stale signal
      # on its own is not stall evidence when the PR shows real progress.
      WORKER_DIR="${WORKTREE_BASE}/${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET}"

      HAS_UPSTREAM=0
      PR_STATE="NONE"

      if [ -n "$BRANCH" ]; then
        COMMITS_AHEAD=$(git -C "$WORKER_DIR" rev-list --count \
          "${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
        if git -C "$WORKER_DIR" ls-remote --heads origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
          HAS_UPSTREAM=1
        fi
        REPO_SLUG=$(git -C "$WORKER_DIR" remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null \
          | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]([^/]+/[^/.]+)(\.git)?$|\1|')

**Auto-revive dead/wedged workers (CTL-63, CTL-62):**

After the stalled-worker scan, attempt to resume any dead, heartbeat-stale, or
API-stream-idle-timeout'd worker from its original `session_id`. Resumed sessions preserve tool-call
history, plan context, and PR state at ~10× lower cost than a fresh redispatch.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-revive" \
  --orch-dir "$ORCH_DIR" \
  --orch-id "$ORCH_NAME"
```

The script checks every non-terminal worker signal and revives when any of:

1. **PID dead** — `kill -0 <pid>` fails (CTL-63)
2. **Heartbeat stale** — `lastHeartbeat` older than 15 minutes (catches zombie-sleep PIDs whose
   process is alive but idle) (CTL-63)
3. **API stream idle timeout** — the tail of `workers/output/<ticket>-stream.jsonl` contains a
   `type=result`, `is_error=true` event whose `api_error_status` or `result` mentions
   `Stream idle timeout` or `partial response received`, and whose `uuid` differs from the signal's
   `lastApiErrorUuid` (CTL-62)

Each successful revive records `lastReviveReason` (`pid-dead` / `heartbeat-stale` /
`api-stream-idle-timeout`) in the signal file and emits a `worker-revived` event with the same
reason in its detail. The per-ticket revive budget (default 10) applies across all reasons combined.
Workers whose budget is exhausted or whose session_id cannot be found transition to `status=stalled`
with an attention item so you can decide between manual intervention and a fresh redispatch. Session
resume uses `workers/output/<ticket>-stream.jsonl` (with legacy / transcript fallbacks) to find the
original `session_id`.

**Auto-resolve already-fixed bot review threads (CTL-378):**

After revive and **before** auto-fixup, a pass resolves unresolved **bot** review threads that the
worker's last pushed commit already addressed — closing the gap where a fix-up worker pushes a
correct fix but dies before calling `resolveReviewThread`, which would otherwise make auto-fixup
dispatch a wasteful second worker.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-resolve-fixed-threads" \
  --orch-dir "$ORCH_DIR" \
  --orch-id "$ORCH_NAME"
```

It reads the shared `blockedSince` clock (written by auto-fixup) and acts only on PRs stably BLOCKED
for `--stable-minutes` (default 10). A thread is auto-resolved only when ALL hold: its author is a
bot (`__typename == "Bot"`); the PR's last pushed commit touches the thread's file; and that commit
landed after the thread's comment. Human-authored threads are never auto-resolved. After resolving
≥1 thread it re-checks the authoritative merge state via REST (`repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}`).

| Field                 | Written by                        | Purpose                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `resolvedThreadCount` | orchestrate-resolve-fixed-threads | Cumulative count of auto-resolved bot threads |
| `threadsResolvedAt`   | orchestrate-resolve-fixed-threads | Timestamp of the most recent auto-resolution  |

Because this runs *before* auto-fixup on the same cycle, any thread it resolves disappears from
auto-fixup's unresolved-thread count, so auto-fixup will not classify the PR as `threads-unresolved`
or consume a `fixupAttempts` budget slot for work that is already done.

**Auto-dispatch fix-up workers for BLOCKED PRs (CTL-64):**

After resolve-fixed-threads, a further pass detects PRs stuck in `state=OPEN,
mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` and either auto-dispatches `orchestrate-fixup` or escalates to an attention
item depending on the cause.

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-auto-fixup" \
  --orch-dir "$ORCH_DIR" \
  --orch-id "$ORCH_NAME"
```

The script records `blockedSince` on the worker signal the first time it observes BLOCKED, then —
once the state has been stable for `--stable-minutes` (default 10) — classifies the cause via
`gh pr view` and an `api graphql` query for unresolved review threads:

| Classification       | Trigger                                             | Action                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ci-running`         | any check `status ∈ {IN_PROGRESS, QUEUED, PENDING}` | defer — try again next tick                                              |
| `checks-failing`     | any check `conclusion ∈ {FAILURE, TIMED_OUT, …}`    | raise `checks-failing` attention (worker's own loop / revive handles it) |
| `threads-unresolved` | checks pass AND unresolved review threads exist     | dispatch `orchestrate-fixup` with `--issues` composed from thread bodies |
| `review-required`    | checks pass AND `reviewDecision = REVIEW_REQUIRED`  | raise `review-required` attention (human must approve)                   |
| `blocked-unknown`    | none of the above (rare — shape not yet classified) | raise `blocked-unknown` attention                                        |

Each auto-dispatch bumps `fixupAttempts` on the signal. When `fixupAttempts ≥ --max-fixups` (default
2), the script raises `fixup-budget-exhausted` attention instead of dispatching again, so a human
can decide between manual intervention and abandonment.

Signal-file fields the script reads/writes:

| Field                   | Written by             | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `blockedSince`          | orchestrate-auto-fixup | First observation of BLOCKED; cleared when PR leaves BLOCKED |
| `fixupAttempts`         | orchestrate-auto-fixup | Auto-dispatch counter (max = `--max-fixups`)                 |
| `lastFixupDispatchedAt` | orchestrate-auto-fixup | Timestamp of the most recent dispatch (for the dashboard)    |

**Auto-dispatch rebase workers for DIRTY PRs (CTL-232):**

After auto-fixup, a further pass detects PRs stuck in `state=OPEN, mergeStateStatus=DIRTY` (merge
conflicts that GitHub's auto-merge cannot resolve on its own — it can only handle BEHIND, never
DIRTY) and dispatches `orchestrate-rebase` to spawn a worker that rebases the PR branch onto current
base, resolves conflicts, and force-pushes (`--force-with-lease`).

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-auto-rebase" \
  --orch-dir "$ORCH_DIR" \
  --orch-id "$ORCH_NAME"
```

The script records `dirtySince` on the worker signal the first time it observes DIRTY, then — once
the state has been stable for `--stable-minutes` (default 2; DIRTY is unambiguous so the window is
much shorter than auto-fixup's 10) — reads `baseRefName` from `gh pr view` and dispatches
`orchestrate-rebase --base-branch <ref>`.

Each auto-dispatch bumps `rebaseAttempts` on the signal. When `rebaseAttempts ≥ --max-rebases`
(default 2), the script raises `rebase-budget-exhausted` attention instead of dispatching again. A
dispatch failure raises `rebase-dispatch-failed` attention.

Signal-file fields the script reads/writes:

| Field                    | Written by              | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dirtySince`             | orchestrate-auto-rebase | First observation of DIRTY; cleared when PR leaves DIRTY   |
| `rebaseAttempts`         | orchestrate-auto-rebase | Auto-dispatch counter (max = `--max-rebases`)              |

**Deregister from catalyst-broker (CTL-257, updated CTL-303):** When all workers in the current wave
reach a terminal state and Phase 4 exits, emit `filter.deregister` so the daemon stops routing
events to this orchestrator:

```bash
if catalyst-broker status >/dev/null 2>&1 || catalyst-filter status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  "$STATE_SCRIPT" event "$(jq -nc \
    --arg orch "${ORCH_NAME}" \
    '{ts: (now | todate), event: "filter.deregister", orchestrator: $orch, worker: null, detail: null}')" \
    2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

### Phase 5: Post-Merge Verification (Anti-Reward-Hacking)

```bash
if [[ -n "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" && -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" phase "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" "verifying" --phase 5
fi
[[ -x "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" ]] && "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" emit \
  --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --phase reviewing --wave "${CURRENT_WAVE:-1}" \
  --summary "wave ${CURRENT_WAVE:-1} post-merge verification" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Context (CTL-130, updated by CTL-252, CTL-56):** Workers actively merge their own PRs via
`gh pr merge --squash` (worktree-safe, CTL-56; no `--auto`) after the listen loop confirms CLEAN,
then delete the remote head ref checkout-free via `gh api --method DELETE`. The merge
happens the moment the worker's listen loop confirms CI passed and reviews are satisfied.
Verification therefore runs **post-merge** — it surfaces gaps for remediation rather than gating
merge.

The Phase 4 merge-confirmation scan (MERGED branch) already runs `orchestrate-verify.sh` on every
merged PR when `verifyBeforeMerge` is `true` (default). Phase 5 aggregates those results and handles
remediation for any failures.

**Aggregation:** For each worker in the current wave, read `postMergeVerification.result` from its
signal file. Three possible states:

1. `"passed"` — verification ran and succeeded, no action needed
2. `"failed"` — verification ran and found gaps, remediation needed
3. `null` — verification hasn't run yet (worker merged between wake-ups, worktree already cleaned
   up, or `verifyBeforeMerge` is `false`)

**On failure — file a remediation ticket:**

Since the code is already on main, the orchestrator cannot "send the worker back." Instead:

1. Read the remediation file at `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET_ID}-remediation.md` (written by Phase
   4 on verification failure)
2. File a follow-up remediation ticket via Linearis CLI with the verification gaps as the
   description
3. Record the ticket ID in the signal file:
   ```bash
   jq --arg ticket "$REMEDIATION_TICKET_ID" \
     '.postMergeVerification.remediationTicket = $ticket' \
     "$WORKER_SIGNAL" > "$WORKER_SIGNAL.tmp" && mv "$WORKER_SIGNAL.tmp" "$WORKER_SIGNAL"
   ```

**Wave advancement gating** (interacts with `allowSelfReportedCompletion`):

- If `ALLOW_SELF_REPORTED` is `"false"` (default) AND any worker has `result: "failed"`: block wave
  advancement until all remediation tickets are filed. The wave does not advance until every worker
  either passes verification or has a filed remediation ticket.
- If `ALLOW_SELF_REPORTED` is `"true"` AND any worker has `result: "failed"`: log a warning, file
  remediation tickets, but allow wave advancement to proceed. Verification is advisory.

The verification script checks:

1. **Unit tests**: For each new/modified source file, verify a corresponding test file exists. Run
   the test suite, verify tests pass.
2. **API tests**: If API routes were added/modified, verify test coverage exists (Bruno collections,
   integration tests, etc.).
3. **Functional tests**: If UI was changed, verify functional/E2E test coverage exists.
4. **Type safety**: Run typecheck command, verify no errors.
5. **Security**: Check for OWASP top 10 patterns in new code.
6. **Reward hacking scan**: Run `/scan-reward-hacking` on changed files — check for `as any`,
   `@ts-ignore`, void patterns, suppressed errors.

**Verification outcomes:**

- **PASS**: All required coverage types present and passing. Worker is fully done.
- **FAIL**: Specific gaps identified. Orchestrator:
  1. Updates dashboard with specific failures
  2. Files a remediation ticket with verification gaps (code is already on main)
  3. Records remediation ticket ID in signal file
  4. Blocks wave advancement if `allowSelfReportedCompletion` is `false` (until remediation ticket
     is filed — not until it is resolved, which would be a future cycle's work)

### Phase 6: Wave Advancement

When ALL tickets in the current wave are merged and verified:

1. **Confirm merges and verification (CTL-130)**: Before advancing the wave, check every worker in
   this wave:
   - `status="done"` with a non-null `pr.mergedAt` — confirms the PR merged
   - If `VERIFY_BEFORE_MERGE` is `"true"`: `postMergeVerification.result` must not be `null`
     (verification must have run)
   - If `ALLOW_SELF_REPORTED` is `"false"` (default) AND any worker has
     `postMergeVerification.result: "failed"`: block wave advancement until all failed workers have
     a non-null `postMergeVerification.remediationTicket` (the remediation ticket has been filed).
     The ticket does not need to be _resolved_ — filing it is sufficient to unblock.
   - If `ALLOW_SELF_REPORTED` is `"true"` AND any worker has `result: "failed"`: log a warning but
     allow wave advancement (verification is advisory)
   - If any worker still shows `pr-created` or `merging`, run one more Phase 4 reactive scan before
     proceeding. If `--auto-merge` is off, flag these PRs for human review on the dashboard instead
     of advancing.

2. **Write wave briefing** for the next wave (see Wave Briefing section below). Then persist a copy
   to the thoughts repository so it survives worktree cleanup:

   ```bash
   HANDOFF_DIR="thoughts/shared/handoffs/${ORCH_NAME}"
   mkdir -p "${HANDOFF_DIR}"
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
   cp "${ORCH_DIR}/wave-${WAVE}-briefing.md" \
      "${HANDOFF_DIR}/${TIMESTAMP}_wave-${WAVE}-briefing.md"
   ```

3. **Clean up completed worktrees**: Run teardown hooks from config, then remove.

   ```bash
   WORKER_DIR="${WORKTREES_BASE}/${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET_ID}"
   BRANCH_NAME="${ORCH_NAME}-${TICKET_ID}"

   # Run teardown hooks from catalyst.orchestration.hooks.teardown
   # Variable substitution: ${WORKTREE_PATH}, ${BRANCH_NAME}, ${TICKET_ID}, ${REPO_NAME}
   for HOOK in $(echo "$TEARDOWN_HOOKS" | jq -r '.[]'); do
     HOOK="${HOOK//\$\{WORKTREE_PATH\}/$WORKER_DIR}"
     HOOK="${HOOK//\$\{BRANCH_NAME\}/$BRANCH_NAME}"
     HOOK="${HOOK//\$\{TICKET_ID\}/$TICKET_ID}"
     eval "$HOOK" || true
   done

   # If teardown hooks didn't already remove the worktree, do it now.
   # CTL-649: stop any bg sessions still cwd'd into this worker dir before
   # yanking the filesystem. Without the presweep, the supervisor session
   # lingers as an ORPHAN (status=idle, cwd=<deleted>) — that's 70% of the
   # 157-session leak observed on the affected host. --force fallback keeps
   # us moving when an individual `claude stop` fails; the periodic reaper
   # picks up any survivors on its next tick.
   if [ -d "$WORKER_DIR" ]; then
     PRESWEEP_BIN="$CATALYST_PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/lib/worktree-presweep.sh"
     if [ -x "$PRESWEEP_BIN" ]; then
       "$PRESWEEP_BIN" "$WORKER_DIR" 2>/dev/null \
         || "$PRESWEEP_BIN" --force "$WORKER_DIR" 2>/dev/null || true
     fi
     git worktree remove "$WORKER_DIR" 2>/dev/null || true
     git branch -D "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || true
   fi
   ```

4. **Provision next wave**: Create worktrees for Wave N+1 tickets using the same
   `create-worktree.sh` invocation from Phase 2.

5. **Dispatch next wave workers**: Include wave briefing in dispatch prompt:

   ```
   IMPORTANT: Read the Wave ${PREV} briefing before starting:
     ${ORCH_DIR}/wave-${PREV}-briefing.md

   This briefing contains patterns, conventions, test helpers, and gotchas
   discovered by the previous wave. Build ON TOP of these — do not reinvent.
   ```

6. **Update dashboard, local state, and global state**: Advance `currentWave`, update wave statuses.

```bash
# Update global state for wave advancement
"$STATE_SCRIPT" update "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  ".progress.currentWave = ${NEXT_WAVE} | .progress.completedTickets += ${COMPLETED_COUNT}"
"$STATE_SCRIPT" event "$(jq -nc \
  --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg orch "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  --argjson wave $NEXT_WAVE \
  --argjson tickets "$(printf '%s\n' "${NEXT_WAVE_TICKETS[@]}" | jq -R . | jq -sc .)" \
  '{ts: $ts, orchestrator: $orch, worker: null, event: "wave-started", detail: {wave: $wave, tickets: $tickets}}')"
NEXT_TOTAL=${#NEXT_WAVE_TICKETS[@]}
[[ -x "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" ]] && "$ORCH_STATUS_SCRIPT" emit \
  --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --phase dispatching --wave "$NEXT_WAVE" \
  --total "$NEXT_TOTAL" \
  --summary "wave ${NEXT_WAVE} dispatching (${NEXT_TOTAL} tickets)" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Phase 7: Completion

When all waves are complete:

1. **Write final summary** to `${ORCH_DIR}/SUMMARY.md`:
   - Total tickets completed
   - Total PRs merged
   - Test coverage summary across all tickets
   - Timeline (start to finish, per-wave durations)
   - Any verification failures that required remediation

   Then render the dashboard one final time so the persisted handoff copy reflects the run's
   terminal state (CTL-230), and persist both alongside any remaining briefings:

   ```bash
   "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/update-dashboard.sh" \
     --orch "${ORCH_NAME}" --orch-dir "${ORCH_DIR}" --roll-usage \
     >/dev/null 2>>"${ORCH_DIR}/.update-dashboard.log" || true

   HANDOFF_DIR="thoughts/shared/handoffs/${ORCH_NAME}"
   mkdir -p "${HANDOFF_DIR}"
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
   cp "${ORCH_DIR}/SUMMARY.md" \
      "${HANDOFF_DIR}/${TIMESTAMP}_${ORCH_NAME}-summary.md"
   cp "${ORCH_DIR}/DASHBOARD.md" \
      "${HANDOFF_DIR}/${TIMESTAMP}_${ORCH_NAME}-dashboard.md"
   ```

2. **Archive orchestrator artifacts** (CTL-110).

   Before any worktree cleanup, sweep artifacts from the runs dir and worktrees into
   `~/catalyst/archives/${ORCH_NAME}/` and index them in `~/catalyst/catalyst.db`. The sweep is
   **filesystem-first**: blobs are written to the archive root BEFORE the SQLite rows are inserted.
   If SQLite write fails, the filesystem artifacts remain on disk (syncable later via
   `catalyst-archive sync`).

   ```bash
   bun "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orch-monitor/catalyst-archive.ts" sweep "${ORCH_NAME}"
   ```

   The sweep is idempotent (`ON CONFLICT` upserts). Re-running is safe. If it fails, capture the
   exit code and `stderr` but proceed with the remaining cleanup steps — artifacts can be re-swept
   later before teardown.

3. **Verify Linear states**: Check all tickets are in `stateMap.done`. If any are stuck, update them
   using the Linearis CLI (run `linearis issues usage` for update syntax).

4. **File improvement findings (CTL-176 / CTL-183 routing):** Drain the shared findings queue and
   file one ticket per entry. The orchestrator and every dispatched worker share one queue (dispatch
   sets `CATALYST_FINDINGS_FILE=$ORCH_DIR/findings.jsonl`), so this one pass covers everything
   surfaced across the whole run. Runs as a no-op when the queue is empty.

   **Recording findings during the run.** The moment you or a worker notices friction worth fixing
   (workflow gaps, bugs spotted in adjacent code, recurring manual steps, gaps in tooling), record
   it on the shared queue:

   ```bash
   "${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/add-finding.sh" \
     --title "Short imperative title" \
     --body "Reproduction + expected + observed + any links" \
     --skill orchestrate --severity low
   ```

   Record inline, the moment it's observed — context compaction loses it otherwise. Don't prompt the
   user mid-run; don't wait for the end; don't batch. Step 4 below files the whole queue in one
   pass.

   **What counts:** friction the maintainer would want fixed, bugs in adjacent catalyst code spotted
   incidentally, gaps in tooling, manual steps that should be automated. **What doesn't:** this
   run's own ticket TODOs (those go in the PR body), user preferences that should be durable memory,
   routine debugging.

   ```bash
   FEEDBACK="${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/file-feedback.sh"
   CONSENT="${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/feedback-consent.sh"
   FINDINGS_FILE="${CATALYST_FINDINGS_FILE:-${ORCH_DIR}/findings.jsonl}"

   if [ -x "$FEEDBACK" ] && [ -f "$FINDINGS_FILE" ] && [ -s "$FINDINGS_FILE" ]; then
     COUNT=$(wc -l < "$FINDINGS_FILE" | tr -d ' ')
     # Autonomous mode (orchestrator runs without a TTY): file only when consent
     # is already granted — never prompt. Interactive maintainer invocations
     # prompt once, then persist on yes.
     if [ "$("$CONSENT" check)" != "granted" ] && [ -z "${CATALYST_AUTONOMOUS:-}" ] && [ -t 0 ]; then
       read -r -p "File $COUNT improvement tickets at end of run? [Y/n] " yn
       case "$yn" in [Nn]*) : ;; *) "$CONSENT" grant >/dev/null ;; esac
     fi
     if [ "$("$CONSENT" check)" = "granted" ]; then
       FILED=0
       while IFS= read -r line; do
         TITLE=$(jq -r '.title' <<<"$line")
         BODY=$(jq -r '.body' <<<"$line")
         SKILL=$(jq -r '.skill // "orchestrate"' <<<"$line")
         RESULT=$("$FEEDBACK" --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY" --skill "$SKILL" --json 2>/dev/null || true)
         STATUS=$(jq -r '.status // "failed"' <<<"$RESULT")
         if [ "$STATUS" = "filed" ]; then
           ID=$(jq -r '.identifier // .url // ""' <<<"$RESULT")
           echo "  filed: $ID  ($TITLE)"
           FILED=$((FILED + 1))
         fi
       done < "$FINDINGS_FILE"
       # Preserve queue on partial failure; delete on full success.
       [ "$FILED" -eq "$COUNT" ] && rm -f "$FINDINGS_FILE"
     fi
   fi
   ```

5. **Clean up all worktrees** (including orchestrator worktree, unless user wants to keep it). Use
   `/catalyst-dev:teardown ${ORCH_NAME}` for a safe, archive-gated deletion. Teardown refuses to run
   unless step 2's sweep succeeded (use `--force` to override).

6. **Sync thoughts**: `humanlayer thoughts sync` to persist any shared documents.

7. **Complete and archive global state**:

```bash
# CTL-111: post orchestrator done to shared comms channel. Workers have already
# posted their own done messages from their merging-loop exit; this closes out the orch
# participant and is advisory — rc is ignored. Channel cleanup is deferred to
# CTL-110's archive sweep (do NOT call `catalyst-comms gc` here — gc is global).
if [ -n "$COMMS_BIN" ]; then
  "$COMMS_BIN" done "${ORCH_NAME}" --as orchestrator >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi

# Mark completed in global state
"$STATE_SCRIPT" update "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  '.status = "completed" | .completedAt = $now | .progress.completedTickets = .progress.totalTickets | .progress.inProgressTickets = 0'
"$STATE_SCRIPT" event "$(jq -nc --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg orch "${ORCH_NAME}" \
  '{ts: $ts, orchestrator: $orch, worker: null, event: "orchestrator-completed", detail: null}')"

# Mark worktree as done (distinguishes done vs in-progress in ls)
touch "${WORKTREE_PATH}/.done" 2>/dev/null || true

# Archive to history (removes from active state)
"$STATE_SCRIPT" archive "${ORCH_NAME}"

# End session tracking
if [[ -n "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" && -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" end "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" --status done
fi
```

8. **Report to user**:

   ```
   Orchestration Complete — "api-redesign"

   Waves: 3/3 complete
   Tickets: 6/6 merged
   PRs: #87, #88, #89, #91, #92, #93
   Duration: 2h 14m

   Verification: 2 tickets required remediation
     - PROJ-101: Missing Bruno API tests (fixed on retry)
     - PROJ-105: as any cast (fixed on retry)

   Summary: ${ORCH_DIR}/SUMMARY.md
   History: ~/catalyst/history/${ORCH_NAME}--<timestamp>.json
   ```

## Wave Briefing Documents

Before dispatching each wave after Wave 1, the orchestrator writes a **briefing document** to
`${ORCH_DIR}/wave-${N}-briefing.md` summarizing what prior waves learned.

**How the briefing is created:**

1. Read each completed worker's PR description
2. Read git diff summaries from each merged PR (`git diff --stat`)
3. Read any research documents workers saved to `thoughts/shared/`
4. Synthesize into: patterns established, new dependencies added, test helpers created, gotchas
   discovered
5. **Pre-assign Supabase migration numbers** for the upcoming wave (see Migration Number Assignments
   below)

Use the wave briefing template from `plugins/dev/templates/orchestrate-wave-briefing.md`.

### Migration Number Assignments (CTL-29)

When two tickets in the same wave both add a Supabase migration, they can race on the same `NNN_`
filename prefix — whichever PR merges first wins, the other must rebase post-PR. The orchestrator
pre-assigns numbers in the briefing to prevent this.

**Generation step** (run before rendering the template):

```bash
# Scan migrations dir and assign numbers to migration-likely tickets in the NEXT wave.
# Prints a Markdown "## Migration Number Assignments" section, or nothing if the
# project has no supabase/migrations/ directory or no ticket in the wave is migration-
# likely. Safe to append unconditionally to the briefing.
MIG_SECTION=$("${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/pre-assign-migrations.sh" \
  --migrations-dir "${ORCH_WORKTREE}/supabase/migrations" \
  --tickets "${NEXT_WAVE_TICKETS[*]}") || MIG_SECTION=""
```

The script replaces the `${MIGRATION_ASSIGNMENTS}` placeholder in the briefing template.

**Detection heuristic** (matches `pre-assign-migrations.sh`):

- Label match (case-insensitive): `database`, `migration`, `schema`
- Keyword match in title or description (case-insensitive): `supabase/migrations`, `migration`,
  `schema`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`

**Behavior:**

- If `supabase/migrations/` does not exist in the orchestrator worktree, the script emits nothing
  (repo-agnostic — projects without Supabase are unaffected).
- If no ticket in the wave is migration-likely, it emits nothing.
- Otherwise it scans for the highest existing `NNN_` prefix and assigns `NNN+1`, `NNN+2`, ... to
  each migration-likely ticket in input order.

**Tests:** `plugins/dev/scripts/__tests__/pre-assign-migrations.test.sh` covers the detection
heuristic, the scanning logic, repo-agnostic fallback, and sequential assignment.

**Thoughts persistence:** Every briefing is copied to `thoughts/shared/handoffs/${ORCH_NAME}/` with
timestamped filenames (`YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_wave-N-briefing.md`). This ensures briefings survive
worktree cleanup and are available via thoughts sync across workspaces. The final `SUMMARY.md` is
also persisted there at completion.

**Why this matters:** This is a unique advantage over other frameworks. GSD executors are stateless.
Gas Town Polecats don't share findings. Wave briefings mean:

- Wave 2+ workers know which patterns to follow
- Wave 2+ workers know which test helpers exist
- Wave 2+ workers know about gotchas discovered by earlier waves
- Knowledge compounds across waves

## Orchestrator Rollup Briefing (CTL-108)

In addition to per-wave briefings (which summarize upstream for downstream workers), the
orchestrator also exposes an **aggregate rollup briefing** for humans reviewing the whole run. The
rollup is **not written by the orchestrator** — it is derived on-read by the orch-monitor from:

1. Worker signal files (`${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${ticket}.json`) — provides the "what shipped" list
   (any worker with `pr.number` set).
2. Per-worker rollup fragments (`${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${ticket}-rollup.md`) — optional markdown files
   written by workers after a successful merge (see `oneshot/SKILL.md` Phase 5 Step 4). Each
   fragment contributes a `### ${ticket}` section to the "Gotchas" area and its first non-blank line
   becomes the one-liner next to the shipped PR.

The orch-monitor assembles these on every snapshot — there is no persisted rollup file to maintain,
no sync step for the orchestrator to run. Workers that do not write a fragment simply appear in
"What shipped" with PR title only.

The rollup surfaces in the orch-monitor UI under the existing Briefing tab (first section, above
per-wave briefings) and as a small `rollup` pill on the orchestrator dashboard card.

## Testing Enforcement (3 Layers)

### Layer 1 — Dispatch Prompt (Prevention)

Every worker dispatch includes mandatory testing requirements in the prompt itself. Not a suggestion
— a hard requirement. The prompt explicitly states that work will be independently verified and
workers should not claim done without tests.

### Layer 2 — Quality Gates (Automated)

The existing quality gate system (`/validate-type-safety`, `/security-review`, `code-reviewer`,
`pr-test-analyzer`) plus config-based gates run inside each worker's `/oneshot` pipeline. These are
the worker's own self-checks.

### Layer 3 — Independent Verification (Adversarial)

The orchestrator's own verification script audits the worker's output AFTER the worker claims done.
This is the anti-reward-hacking layer — the worker can't game its own quality gates because the
orchestrator runs a separate, adversarial check. The verification agent has no incentive to pass —
it's scored on catching gaps, not shipping fast.

## Dashboard

The orchestrator maintains a live dashboard at `${ORCH_DIR}/DASHBOARD.md`. Re-rendered on each
Monitor wake-up (per-event), not on a poll cycle. Uses the template from
`plugins/dev/templates/orchestrate-dashboard.md`.

The dashboard includes:

- Orchestrator metadata (name, start time, project, base branch)
- Current wave progress
- Per-worker status table with test coverage columns
- Blocked waves with dependency information
- Timestamped event log

## Linear Integration

The orchestrator manages Linear state transitions as the primary authority (CTL-133):

| Event                      | Linear Action                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Worker dispatched          | Move ticket to `stateMap.inProgress`              |
| Worker creates PR          | Verify ticket is `stateMap.inReview` — fix if not |
| Worker passes verification | No change (already in review)                     |
| PR merged                  | Verify ticket is `stateMap.done` — fix if not     |
| Worker fails/stalls        | Add comment with status, keep `inProgress`        |

The orchestrator also adds comments to tickets for visibility using the Linearis CLI (run
`linearis comments usage` for syntax).

### Single source of truth: `linear-transition.sh`

All Linear state transitions go through `plugins/dev/scripts/linear-transition.sh`. Since CTL-133,
the orchestrator's Phase 4 monitor is the primary source of `done` transitions (workers exit at
`merging` before merge completes). The helper reads `stateMap` from `.catalyst/config.json`, is
idempotent (no-op when the ticket is already in the target state), and exits 0 when the `linearis`
CLI is not installed (graceful skip).

```bash
# Transition via transition-key (reads stateMap.done from config):
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/linear-transition.sh" \
  --ticket PROJ-123 --transition done --config .catalyst/config.json

# Override with an explicit state name (e.g., --state-on-merge "Shipped"):
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/linear-transition.sh" \
  --ticket PROJ-123 --state "Shipped" --config .catalyst/config.json
```

The `--state-on-merge` flag on orchestrate is passed through to this helper whenever it is set.

### Retroactive bulk-close: `orchestrate-bulk-close`

For runs that predated the state-transition wiring (or where the orchestrator's monitor exited
before reconciling tickets), run the bulk-close helper. It walks `workers/*.json`, inspects each PR
via `gh`, and transitions tickets via `linear-transition.sh`:

- Merged PR with non-empty diff → `stateMap.done`
- Merged PR with zero diff (subsumed) → `stateMap.canceled`
- No PR, signal `status=done` (zero-scope) → `stateMap.canceled`
- Worker still in progress → skip (bulk-close is for reconciliation only)

```bash
# Preview what the helper would do (no changes):
plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-bulk-close --orch-dir ~/catalyst/runs/<orch-name> --dry-run

# Actually transition tickets:
plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-bulk-close --orch-dir ~/catalyst/runs/<orch-name>

# JSON summary for scripting:
plugins/dev/scripts/orchestrate-bulk-close --orch-dir ~/catalyst/runs/<orch-name> --json
```

Flags mirror orchestrate: `--state-on-merge <name>` and `--state-on-canceled <name>` override the
respective defaults.

## Named Orchestrators & Remote Control

Start the orchestrator with remote control for access from claude.ai/code. The orchestrator worktree
was already created in Phase 2, so `cd` into it — do not pass `-w` (that would ask claude to create
a _new_ worktree using the path as a name):

```bash
( cd "${ORCH_WORKTREE}" && claude --remote-control "${ORCH_NAME}" )
```

Workers should NOT use remote control — they're autonomous. The human monitors workers through the
orchestrator's dashboard.

**Multiple orchestrators** can run concurrently. Worktree names are prefixed with the orchestrator
name to avoid collisions:

```
${WORKTREE_BASE}/
├── auth-orch/                    # orchestrator 1
├── auth-orch-PROJ-101/           # orchestrator 1's worker

## Worker Communication

Workers write status updates to `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${TICKET_ID}.json`. The `/oneshot` skill
detects orchestrator presence by checking for a sibling `orchestrator/` directory or the
`CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR` environment variable.

**Worker signal file schema:** See `plugins/dev/templates/worker-signal.json` for the full JSON
schema including the `definitionOfDone` block.

**How workers detect orchestrator mode:**

```bash
# Detection order:
# 1. CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR env var (set by orchestrator in dispatch)
# 2. Sibling directory matching *-orchestrator or <prefix>/ pattern
# 3. ../*/workers/ directory exists (convention-based)
ORCH_DIR="${CATALYST_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR:-}"
if [ -z "$ORCH_DIR" ]; then
  # Check for sibling orchestrator directory
  PARENT=$(dirname "$(pwd)")
  ORCH_DIR=$(find "$PARENT" -maxdepth 1 -name "*/workers" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's|/workers$||')
fi
```

## Recovery Paths: Fix-up Worker vs Follow-up Ticket

Under the CTL-80 contract, workers poll until `state=MERGED` and exit at `done`. If a worker exits
earlier (`stalled`, `failed`, or process crash), or if findings surface after merge, the
orchestrator triages them. Two recovery patterns cover the cases that came up in
`orch-data-import-2026-04-13` Round 2:

### Decision Tree

```
Did the PR already merge?
├── No — PR is still OPEN
│   └── Blockers on the existing PR (Codex inline threads, CI failure, missed review point).
│       → Pattern A: FIX-UP WORKER  (orchestrate-fixup)
│
└── Yes — PR is MERGED
    └── Findings surfaced AFTER merge (late scan, post-merge review, prod observation).
        → Pattern B: FOLLOW-UP TICKET  (orchestrate-followup)
```

Ask `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json state` before choosing. `OPEN` → fix-up. `MERGED`/`CLOSED` →
follow-up. If the PR is `MERGED` you physically cannot push to that branch anymore; a fix-up attempt
will fail silently or push to an orphan branch.

### Pattern A: Fix-up Worker (PR still open)

Used on ADV-219 / PR #130 and ADV-220 / PR #132 during `orch-data-import-2026-04-13`. Either the
original worker exited at `stalled` because Codex or a security scanner posted inline threads it
could not resolve in its own poll loop, or the worker process died before reaching MERGED.
Auto-merge is blocked on unresolved threads.

**When to use:**

- `pr.state = OPEN`
- Blockers are specific and file:line-scoped (inline review comments, CI test failures, lint errors)
- The remediation is a small targeted patch, not a re-design

**How the orchestrator dispatches:**

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-fixup" "${TICKET}" \
  --issues "src/auth/middleware.ts:42: handle null session token
src/auth/middleware.ts:89: Codex flagged timing-attack comparison
test/auth.test.ts: add regression test for the null-token path" \
  --pr "${PR_NUMBER}" \
  --dispatch
```

`--issues` accepts a multi-line value verbatim — pass each blocker on its own
line as shown above and the rendered prompt's `## Blockers to resolve` section
will contain every line in order. No caller-side escaping or `\n`-joining is
required.

What this does:

1. Renders `templates/fixup-prompt.md` → `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/fixup-${TICKET}-prompt.md`
2. Renders `templates/dispatch-fixup.sh.template` →
   `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/dispatch-fixup-${TICKET}.sh`
3. With `--dispatch`, runs the dispatch script in the background (via `claude -p` with streaming
   JSON output)

The fix-up worker:

- Pulls latest on the existing PR branch (does NOT create a new branch)
- Resolves ONLY the listed blockers
- Pushes ONE commit with message `fix(...): resolve review feedback on #${PR}`
- Resolves review threads via `gh api graphql resolveReviewThread`
- Writes its commit SHA to the worker signal file as `fixupCommit`
- Polls until `state=MERGED` (CTL-80 contract), writes `pr.mergedAt` + `status: "done"`, transitions
  Linear, then exits

The orchestrator's Phase 4 monitor is the authoritative merge watcher: if the fix-up worker exits
before merge, the orchestrator observes the eventual `MERGED` state via the next `github.pr.merged`
event (or 10-minute idle fallback) and writes the merge signal. `fixupCommit` is metadata for the
dashboard.

**Typical cost:** ~$2 (much cheaper than a fresh worker because scope is narrow).

### Pattern B: Follow-up Ticket (PR already merged)

Used on ADV-221 → ADV-222 / PR #133 during `orch-data-import-2026-04-13`. The parent PR merged
cleanly; a post-merge security review or prod observation surfaced issues later. A fix-up is
physically impossible — the merged branch is gone.

**When to use:**

- `pr.state = MERGED`
- New findings that would have blocked merge if they had arrived 10 minutes earlier
- Traceability to the parent is important (audit, incident response)

**How the orchestrator dispatches:**

```bash
"${CATALYST_DEV_SCRIPTS}/orchestrate-followup" "${PARENT_TICKET}" \
  --findings "post-merge: validateSessionToken allows empty string (src/auth/middleware.ts:42)
post-merge: missing rate-limit on POST /api/auth/token (src/api/auth.ts:18)"
```

What this does:

1. Files a new Linear ticket via `linearis issues create`, with description that references the
   parent and enumerates the findings. Title defaults to
   `Follow-up: <PARENT_TICKET> post-merge findings`; override with `--title`.
2. Provisions a fresh worktree off `main` via `create-worktree.sh`, named
   `${ORCH_NAME}-${NEW_TICKET}`.
3. Seeds the new worker's signal file with `followUpTo: "${PARENT_TICKET}"` — the orchestrator and
   dashboard both use this field to render the ancestry.
4. Renders `templates/followup-prompt.md` → `${ORCH_DIR}/workers/${NEW_TICKET}-prompt.md`, which
   points the worker at the findings, the parent PR, and the TDD contract.
5. Prints the `claude -p` command to actually start the worker — it does NOT auto-dispatch
   (follow-up tickets are heavier and warrant human confirmation).

The follow-up worker runs the full `/oneshot` pipeline (research → plan → implement → validate →
ship), same as any other worker. Its PR description must reference the parent PR number; the prompt
enforces this.

**Typical cost:** ~$4 (full pipeline, but scoped to the findings).

**Skip Linear ticket creation** with `--ticket <id>` if you filed the ticket manually or Linear is
unavailable. The rest of the flow proceeds with the given ticket ID.

### Signal file metadata

| Field         | Written by                     | Pattern |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `fixupCommit` | fix-up worker (after push)     | A       |
| `followUpTo`  | orchestrator (at provisioning) | B       |

These fields are additive — they do not conflict with `pr.prOpenedAt`, `pr.autoMergeArmedAt`, or
`pr.mergedAt` (which remain worker-owned / orchestrator-owned per the normal split).

### Dashboard columns

`DASHBOARD.md` has two additional columns: `Fix-up Commit` (short SHA, empty for normal workers) and
`Follow-up To` (parent ticket ID, empty for normal workers and fix-up workers). See
`templates/orchestrate-dashboard.md`.

## Error Handling

**All error paths that stop the orchestrator must end the session:**

```bash
if [[ -n "${CATALYST_SESSION_ID:-}" && -x "$SESSION_SCRIPT" ]]; then
  "$SESSION_SCRIPT" end "$CATALYST_SESSION_ID" --status failed
fi
```

**Worker crashes or stalls:**

- Monitor detects no progress for 15+ minutes (no commits, no signal updates)
- Dashboard marks worker as "stalled"
- Orchestrator does NOT auto-restart — flags for human decision
- Options presented: restart worker, skip ticket, investigate manually

**Orchestrator crash recovery:**

- All state is in `${ORCH_DIR}/state.json` + worker signal files
- Resume with: `/catalyst-dev:orchestrate --resume ${ORCH_DIR}`
- Reads state.json, determines current wave, checks each worker's actual status
- Picks up where it left off
- On resume, start a new session (the old one leaked — this is acceptable)

**Worktree conflicts:**

- If a worktree path already exists, skip creation and check if it's from a previous run
- If it has a valid worker signal file, treat as a resumed worker

## Important

- The orchestrator lives in its own worktree and **never modifies code**
- Workers are fully autonomous — they run `/oneshot` with all its phases
- Wave advancement requires ALL tickets in the wave to pass verification
- The `--auto-merge` flag applies to workers, not the orchestrator
- Dashboard and state files are ephemeral — they don't survive worktree removal
- Wave briefings, summaries, and the final dashboard are persisted to
  `thoughts/shared/handoffs/${ORCH_NAME}/` for archival (CTL-230)
- Wave briefings are the key differentiator — knowledge compounds across waves
- The 3-layer testing enforcement prevents the observed failure mode of agents skipping tests
- CTL-26 dependency: Uses `.catalyst/` paths. Falls back to `.claude/` if `.catalyst/` doesn't exist
